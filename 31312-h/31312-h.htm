<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>BACK OF THE TRENCHES</span></h2>

<p>"Tom, what do you suppose that strange
man who looked like a French peasant, yet
wasn't one, could have been up to late yesterday
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You mean the fellow discovered near the
hangars at the aviation camp, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He seemed to go out of sight like a
wreath of smoke does. Why, if the ground had
opened and swallowed him up, once the hue
and cry was raised, he couldn't have vanished
quicker. I wonder if what they say about him
can be true?"</p>

<p>"That he was a German spy? Anything is
possible in war times."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right there. German secret
sympathizers, and spies in the bargain, seemed
to bob up all over the United States before we
crossed the ocean to do our fighting for France
as aviators."</p>

<p>"They certainly were busy bees, Jack, blowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
up munition-works, trying to destroy big
railroad bridges so as to cripple traffic with
the Allies over here; burning grain elevators
in which France and Great Britain had big
supplies of wheat stored; and even putting
bombs aboard ocean liners that were timed to
explode days later, when the boat would be a
thousand miles from land."</p>

<p>"Over in France here they make short work
of spies, I've heard, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a drumhead court martial and trial.
Then, if the man or woman is found guilty,
the spy goes out with a firing squad to the
most convenient stone wall. They never return,
Jack."</p>

<p>"Whee! that sounds like war times, doesn't
it? And to think the two of us are right on
the firing line, in the midst of all the scrapping.
But, Tom, tell me, why should a tricky German
spy want to hang out around the aviation field?
He could hardly expect to pick up any news
there that would be worth taking across the
lines to the headquarters of the Crown Prince
before Verdun."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that, Jack. Perhaps
he might learn of some contemplated bombing
expedition, like that one we went on not
so long ago." And Tom Raymond smiled
slightly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>"They are a mighty clever bunch, those
spies," admitted Jack Parmly.</p>

<p>"Why, Jack, half of the successes of the
Kaiser's armies on all fronts, Russia, France
and Rumania, can be laid at the door of his
secret agents. They seem to be everywhere,
trying to foment internal troubles, strikes, and
discontent, so that when the Germans strike
hard they meet a divided enemy in front."</p>

<p>"Well, I certainly wish we had caught that
fellow."</p>

<p>"You were in the crowd, you told me, that
scoured the whole neighborhood in search of
him."</p>

<p>"That's right, I was. But say, he proved too
foxy for us all. Anyway, we failed to find the
rascal. Then night came on, when we had to
give our man-hunt over. And to think that I
even glimpsed the fellow's face in the bargain
before the alarm went out!"</p>

<p>"Then you'd know him again perhaps, Jack,
if ever you met him?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Though I suppose these spies
have ways of changing their looks at times.
But, to change the subject, Tom, it strikes me
neither of us is groaning under the weight of
game so far on our little side hunt." And Jack
Parmly grinned.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't really expect to run across anything,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
though that French peasant assured us
there were still some rabbits in the burrows
over here, three miles back of our sleeping
quarters. That's why, with a day off-duty, I
took a notion to borrow an old Belgian-made
double-barrel shotgun he owned, and walk out
here."</p>

<p>"More to stretch our legs and get the kinks
out, than anything else, eh, Tom?"</p>

<p>"That's it, Jack. Don't you remember that
while we were training at the aviation school
at Pau we used often to walk from the town,
eight miles distant, until we sighted that famous
little old red barn at Pau, where the Wright
Brothers conducted some of their experiments
in flying heavier-than-air machines. That was
some little hike."</p>

<p>"Then too, Tom, I guess we wanted to get
together by ourselves for a change, so we could
talk about our folks at home in little old Bridgeton,
U. S. A.," went on Jack Parmly with a sigh.
"All the fellows of the Lafayette Escadrille are
mighty kind and sociable, but there are times
when a fellow gets homesick. Just remember
that we have been over here many months now.
It seems years to me, Tom."</p>

<p>"Say, I hope you are not homesick enough
to want to go back, old fellow?"</p>

<p>"Not me, Tom. I made up my mind to stick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
it out until we whip the Kaiser. But already
I can see it'll never be an accomplished fact
until Uncle Sam throws his sword into the
scales. And any day now something may drop."</p>

<p>"Yes, matters are at an acute stage in Washington,
that's sure. All France, bled nearly
white in two-and-a-half years of war, is praying
that the day may come soon."</p>

<p>After that the two athletic looking young
Americans, dressed in the uniform of the
French aviation corps, fell silent for a brief time.
They, however, continued to trudge over the
devastated fields, looking this way and that for
any sign of a stray rabbit that had escaped the
general slaughter.</p>

<p>It was just previous to the world-stirring session
of Congress, when the President made his
thrilling speech that sounded almost from end to
end of the world, and put America in line for
the cause of democracy. Anxious days those
were across the ocean, anxious not only in
France, Italy and Great Britain, in Serbia, Rumania,
Greece and Russia, but in the Central
Empires, also.</p>

<p>For well did those in Teutonic authority
know, in spite of their vain boasting, that once
great America decided, the thing was bound to
be done, sooner or later. Never in the course
of her history has our republic been on a losing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
side. Her wars have invariably brought eventual
victory to her arms, because she has never once
fought for an unjust cause.</p>

<p>These two vigorous young fellows were fair
samples of those enterprising Americans who
found it impossible to sit idly by. They could
not await the slow course of events that was
bound to carry our country into the world war
on the side of the Allies, in spite of all the
powerful counter currents among the pro-German
citizens at home.</p>

<p>Dozens of the brightest of flying men from
the States had gone over and offered their
services to France, the country they loved. In
time there came to be so many, that from the
ordinary French Flying Corps there was formed
a unit entirely made up of Americans.</p>

<p>This, in honor of the one great Frenchman
whom Americans most honor at home, was
called the Lafayette Escadrille. Some of its
members had become famous at their profession.
Names like those of Lufbery, Thaw, McConnell,
Chapman, Prince, Rockwell, Hill, Rumsey,
Johnson, Balsley and others became household
words among readers of the great dailies in the
States.</p>

<p>Tom Raymond was the son of a man who had
gained fame as an inventor. When the war
broke out he started work on numerous inventions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
some of which were calculated to become
terrible agents for the destruction of human
life. Then Mr. Raymond's mood changed, and
he set to work to conceive a wonderful stabilizer
for airplane use that would save myriads of
lives, and if adopted by Uncle Sam was likely to
help win the war for the Allies.</p>

<p>Just when this invention was finished a drawing
of one of the parts was stolen by a German
spy. Later on, after Tom and his chum, Jack
Parmly had decided to become war aviators,
having already had considerable aviation experience,
they went to the flying school conducted
by the Government in Virginia.</p>

<p>From there in course of time they crossed
the Atlantic and entered the famous French
school at Pau. Then, having mastered the
science of flying sufficiently to be sent to the
front, they had joined the Lafayette Escadrille,
as related in a previous volume entitled "Air
Service Boys Flying for France; or The Young
Heroes of the Lafayette Escadrille."</p>

<p>Tom in particular seemed to have a great
career ahead of him, unless some unfortunate
accident, or possibly a Teuton pilot, cut it short,
as had happened in the cases of Rockwell,
Prince, McConnell and Chapman. Every one
knew he possessed genius of a high order, and
that it would not be long before Tom Raymond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
might anticipate gaining the proud title of
"<i>ace</i>," which would indicate that he had defeated
five enemies at different times, and put them
entirely out of the running.</p>

<p>Tom was already a corporal in the French
service, and expected before a great while to
be given the privilege of wearing the chevrons
of a sergeant. Jack had not progressed so
rapidly but was doing well.</p>

<p>And now to return to the young aviators
during their walk.</p>

<p>"I reckon we've gone far enough, Jack," Tom
remarked presently. "Our friend Jean may have
been telling the truth when he said there were
still a few bunnies left alive in this war-racked
section of country, but I can see they've got
the good sense to stick to their burrows during
the daytime. We won't be burdened with our
bag of game on the return trip."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's always the trouble, when you go
out after rabbits and haven't any hound along
to get them up and bring them within gunshot,"
grumbled Jack.</p>

<p>"But we've had a good walk," returned his
companion; "and for a time we managed to get
away from that terrible explosion of shells, and
big-gun firing. We ought to be thankful for
our little time off, Jack."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm not really complaining," remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
the other young aviator, with a whimsical
expression on his good-natured face. "But don't
you know I hate to go back without having
fired even one shot." He stopped short and
pointed upward. "Hold on, Tom; there's some
kind of bird going to pass over right now!
Crow or anything, please bring it down! I'll
promise to eat it, no matter what it is."</p>

<p>Laughingly Tom threw the gun up to his
shoulder, and the next instant the report
sounded. It seemed almost contemptible, after
listening to the roar of those monster shells
exploding for so long.</p>

<p>The bird fell fluttering in a heap. Tom evidently
was a fair marksman, for it had been
moving swiftly over their heads at the time he
fired. Jack ran forward and picked the game
up. As he did so he gave utterance to exclamations
that naturally excited the curiosity of his
chum. So Tom, after reloading his gun with a
fresh shell, waited for Jack to rejoin him, which
the other did, his face full of mystery.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WINGED MESSENGER</span></h2>

<p>"What do you call this, Tom? A queer sort
of crow, I'd say. Looks more to me like the
blue-rock pigeons Sam Becker used to raise at
home," and so saying Jack held up the still
quivering bunch of feathers.</p>

<p>Tom took one quick look, and then a startled
expression flitted across his face.</p>

<p>"Just what it is, Jack!" he hastened to say.
"A homing pigeon in the bargain! You can
tell that from the bill and the ring around the
eyes."</p>

<p>Jack in turn became aroused.</p>

<p>"A homing pigeon, is it?" he ejaculated.
"Why, birds like that are used for carrying
messages across the lines! Some of our airplane
pilots have told me that sometimes they take
a French spy far back of the German front.
When he had made an important discovery he
would write a message in cipher, enclose it in
a tiny waterproof capsule attached to a ring
about the pigeon's leg, and set the bird free.
Inside of half an hour it would be safe back in
its loft, and the message on the way to French
headquarters."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>He lifted one limp leg, and then the other.</p>

<p>"Look here, it's got a message, as sure as
anything!" Jack exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom leaned forward and took the bird in his
hand, dropping the gun meanwhile. He carefully
took off the gelatine capsule, and from
it extracted a delicate piece of tough paper,
which he spread open. There were a series of
strange marks on the paper, of which neither
of the air service boys could make anything.</p>

<p>"Looks like hieroglyphics, such as you'd expect
to find on an Egyptian tomb or in the
burial places under the pyramids," complained
Jack, after he had stared at the lines in disgust
for a brief period of time.</p>

<p>"It's a cipher of some kind," explained Tom,
seriously. "With the key all this would resolve
itself into some sort of communication, I suppose,
connected with valuable information concerning
the French armies here at Verdun."</p>

<p>"Then it was made by a spy!"</p>

<p>"No question about that part of it," came
the ready reply.</p>

<p>"This carrier pigeon with this message, was
on its way across to some point in the rear
of the enemy line when you fired, and brought
the poor little thing down in a quivering heap,
I'm sure that's it," continued the other.</p>

<p>"Yes. And so after all it's turned out to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
be a lucky thing you chanced to see the bird
coming along, Jack, and begged me to knock
it down so we could show some sort of game
when we got back to camp."</p>

<p>"What ought we do with this message?"
asked Jack, accustomed to depending on his
more energetic chum in many cases; though
when left to his own resources he could think
for himself, as had frequently been proved.</p>

<p>"I shall see that it gets to French headquarters,
with an account of the singular way we
ran across it," Tom told him.</p>

<p>"Do you think it would be possible for any
one there to translate this cipher of the German
secret code?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Tom demanded. "They are
clever people, these wideawake French, and I
shouldn't be at all surprised if they turned this
incident to some good use."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it could be done in many ways. Suppose
they found the key to the code. Don't
you see how a fictitious message could be sent
on in some way, if they could bag another
pigeon from the same coop? They might even
coax the Germans to deliver a furious attack
at a supposed weak place in the line, which
would of course be heavily guarded."</p>

<p>"That would be something worth while!" exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
the other with glowing eyes. "Lead
them into a trap, where they would be mowed
down like ripe grain, terrible as that sounds!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the idea I had in mind. But
it would depend on several things. First of all
would come the successful solving of this cipher
code."</p>

<p>"Yes, and then the finding of another homing
pigeon," added Jack. "I wonder if the fellow
who released that bird could have a lot more
of the same kind hidden away somewhere around
back here."</p>

<p>"I was just going to suggest that we take
a turn toward the south, and look around a
bit before going back to camp. Do you feel
equal to it, Jack?"</p>

<p>"What, me! Tom? Why, I'm as fresh as a
daisy! This business has made me forget there's
such a thing as getting tired walking."</p>

<p>"Let's see, we stood here when I fired,"
continued Tom reflectively, "and you walked
straight to where the bird dropped. That would
make the direction due northwest by southeast.
How about that, Jack?"</p>

<p>The other took a survey, and then pointed
with his hand.</p>

<p>"When I saw the bird coming first of all,
Tom," he finally remarked, "it was just showing
up over that clump of trees killed by gunfire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
And it was heading as straight as can be for
us."</p>

<p>"Yes," Tom went on to say, "because a
homing pigeon on being released will rise to
a certain height and take its bearings. Then it
starts in a bee-line for its loft, whether that is
five miles away or hundreds of miles. Some
peculiar instinct tells it in which way home lies.
It seldom if ever goes astray. Sometimes birds
have made a thousand miles, and shown up at
their home coop days after being set free."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the man who threw it into the
air, after fastening this cipher message to it,
must be over to the southeast of us," affirmed
Jack.</p>

<p>"The bird was released within five minutes
or so of the time I fired," Tom told his chum.
"It's even possible the spy may have heard the
report of my gun."</p>

<p>"Tom, why not try to capture that spy?"
asked Jack, eagerly, ready for any sort of excitement.</p>

<p>The young aviators started off, walking briskly.
They kept their eyes alertly open as they
proceeded. At the same time, on Tom's
suggestion, they continued to act as though still
looking for game, even investigating at a burrow
that certainly was used by rabbits, as the
tracks plainly indicated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>Tom never deviated from a direct line due
southeast. He knew that their best chance of
making a valuable discovery lay in finding the
place where the carrier pigeon had been released,
to fly across the lines to its home loft.
This might be many miles to the rear of the
fighting front, even on Lorraine territory, in
the neighborhood of the fortified city of Metz
itself.</p>

<p>The two passed over a mile without making
any sort of discovery, Jack, who did not possess
quite as determined a nature as his comrade,
was already commencing to make certain
sounds akin to complainings, as though he felt
keenly disgruntled because of their lack of success.</p>

<p>"Guess we'll have to give it up, Tom," he
finally remarked.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Tom. "Before doing that let's
investigate that old shattered farmhouse over
yonder."</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Jack, plucking up some
fresh interest, "have you located one of those
remains of a building, then? I was coming to
believe there wasn't so much as a broken wall
left standing for a space of five square miles,
so complete has been the destruction. But I
see what you mean, Tom."</p>

<p>They walked ahead again, and approached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
the ruined farmhouse. It had been riddled
through and through by shot and shell. Three-fourths
of the original building lay in piles, the
stones heaped up as they had fallen.</p>

<p>"Queer, isn't it, that the kitchen part escaped
the smashing fire, and still stands," observed
Jack. "I warrant you this is the only part of
a building left around here. Tom, would our
spy be likely to take up his headquarters in
such a place as this, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," came the answer. "We can
soon find out."</p>

<p>"He might feel desperate enough to open
fire on us," suggested Jack, though he did
not shrink or hold back when Tom advanced;
for Jack Parmly did not have a drop of
cowardly blood in his veins.</p>

<p>Tom turned and waved his hand as though
beckoning to others who might be coming after
them. He even called out in his best French,
as if there were a dozen back of him, that
there was a possibility of securing at least a
drink of cold water at the old-fashioned well
with a sweep that stood near the kitchen of the
ruined farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Good idea, Tom!" commented the other,
chuckling with amusement. "If he gets the
notion in his head that we are legion he won't
be so apt to blaze away at us, knowing it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
mean a short shrift for him. He may prefer
to play the poor French peasant part, and try
to pull the wool over our eyes."</p>

<p>Presently they arrived at the door. It was
hanging from one hinge, and the entire place
presented a vivid picture of the utter desolation
cruel war always brings in its train.</p>

<p>Tom's first act before entering was to look
down at the ground just before the door. Some
intuition told him that if the place had been
recently occupied they would possibly find some
evidences of the fact in the earth.</p>

<p>"See there, Jack!" he suddenly exclaimed,
as he pointed down close to his feet. "Fresh
tracks, and made by a man's shoes in the
bargain!"</p>

<p>"Some one has been in here for a fact, Tom,
and I wouldn't be afraid to wager he saw us
coming and cleared out in a hurry. He could
have skirted those bushes, and got clear easy
enough. Do you think it could have been
the same chap who freed that pigeon?"</p>

<p>"No doubt about it," and Tom, stooping,
picked up some small object. "See, here's a
feather that was sticking to that dead weed.
It's from a bird of the same color as the pigeon,
perhaps from the very one I've got in my
pocket."</p>

<p>"That settles it," snapped the pleased Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
"I must say you're a clever hand at finding
these things out. I'd have never dreamed of
looking down at my feet, but blundered right
into the shack to see if&#8213;Oh! What do you
think of the luck we're in this day, Tom? See
what stands there on that poor old three-legged
table!"</p>

<p>Jack's excitement was natural, as Tom readily
understood when he looked; for there was a
small basket or cage made from oziers or willow
wands; and inside this they could see two blue
gray homing pigeons, mates to the one Tom
had shot only a short time before!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SPY BAFFLED</span></h2>

<p>Both young aviators stared at the wicker
cage containing the two pigeons. The birds
had been still up to then, but now commenced
to make cooing sounds, as though pleased at
having human company. Apparently they were
inclined to be sociable, as Jack afterwards put
it.</p>

<p>"So he discovered us coming along," Jack
went on to say, "and skipped out in such a
hurry he didn't have time to carry away the
cage with him."</p>

<p>"He must have climbed out of this window
in the side of the wall," observed Tom. "We
could have seen him if he had used the door.
Yes, there are footprints underneath the window.
He ran down behind those bushes and reached
the stone wall that leads to the broken country
and what is left of the woods."</p>

<p>"The chances are he had all that mapped out
beforehand," suggested Jack. "Surely a spy
has always to keep a door open for retreat."</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not? They take their lives in
their hands every time they enter the hostile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
lines, and you can't blame a man for wanting to
live a little longer, especially if he believes he
can serve his country."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he hasn't got such a good start
but that we could overtake him if we went after
him now," suggested Jack.</p>

<p>"We might take a turn that way," his chum
agreed. "But not too far afield. We didn't
start out to search for spies, and we've only
got a single gun between us. Even my automatic
was left behind, because I didn't expect
to have any use for it, and get tired carrying
the thing, with its belt."</p>

<p>"But these pigeons here, Tom?"</p>

<p>"We can leave them until we get back.
That's one reason why I don't want to get
out of sight of the place. He might make a
round, and carry the birds away while we were
engaged in a hunt half a mile off. And it
may be of much more importance that those
live birds arrive in the French camp than that
we should bag the spy."</p>

<p>"I get you, Tom; so let's commence our little
man-hunt right away."</p>

<p>The two friends set off. Tom tried to follow
the course he believed the spy must have taken
on quitting the old farmhouse ruins. That
his reckoning was clear he proved several times
by pointing out to his companion plain evidences
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
that some other person had passed along the
way before them.</p>

<p>Here the marks of shoes could be detected
in the soft earth. A little further on, and at
a point where the man must have crawled in
order to keep from being seen, they found
tracks where his toes had dragged along, as well
as the indentation of his knees in the soil.</p>

<p>Presently they arrived at the terminus of the
stone wall, about the only thing remaining
intact connected with the French farm. There
was not a single tree showing signs of life in
that patch of sombre forest; where shell-fire
had failed to do the work of destruction a
malicious hand had girdled the trunk with a
keen-edged tool, and thus encompassed the
doom of the trees.</p>

<p>Tom came to a pause.</p>

<p>"I reckon we've come far enough," he said,
taking a look over toward the fragment of
a house on the slight elevation, which could
just be seen from their present position.</p>

<p>"I'd have liked to catch up with that duck
and march him back to camp, along with
his feathered messengers," Jack grumbled
disappointedly. "Somehow I hate and despise a
spy above all created things."</p>

<p>The youths set their faces once more in the
direction of the ruins, where they soon arrived.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
Jack half feared that in spite of them the cage
and its feathered inmates had been spirited
away. He hastened inside ahead of his companion
and then called out cheerily:</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tom, and nobody at home.
Here's the wicker cage and the pigeons, just
as we left them!"</p>

<p>"As the afternoon is passing, and we have
a long distance to go, we'd better be making
a start," Tom remarked, when he reached the
open door.</p>

<p>"Let me carry the pigeon cage, Tom, as you
have the gun," suggested Jack, after slipping
his hand through the ring at the top. "Say,
perhaps the boys won't give us a laugh, to see
what queer game we've brought back from our
hunt!"</p>

<p>They left the ruins of the once peaceful farmhouse
behind them, and commenced retracing
their steps. Tom was too old a hand at hunting
to get lost. He had kept his bearings through
the whole tramp, no matter how many turns
they took in examining some promising ground
where rabbit burrows might be found. On this
account then he would have no difficulty whatever
in leading his comrade straight back to
the villa in which the entire Lafayette Escadrille
of American fliers was quartered.</p>

<p>They were passing along about half a mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
from the wrecked farmhouse kitchen, and not
far from the spot where Tom made his successful
shot, when without warning the report of
a gun came to their ears. Jack involuntarily
ducked his head.</p>

<p>"Say, did you hear that whining sound just
over us, Tom? That was caused by a bullet
skipping past!"</p>

<p>Tom for answer dragged his chum down
behind a fringe of dead bushes that chanced
to lie close by.</p>

<p>"It was a bullet, all right, Jack," he replied,
not without a tremor in his voice, for this
thing of being made a target by some murderous
unseen person was a new and novel experience.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it was fired by the man
who owns these pigeons?" further questioned
Jack, though showing no intention of loosening
his grip on the wicker cage.</p>

<p>"It could hardly be any one else. He has
dogged us this far, or else just happened to
catch sight of us. That shot was fired from
a distance, and if we take a notion to run he
couldn't possibly hit us. But we might as well
make use of this fringe of bushes to creep some
way off. Then we'll get on our feet and put
out for home at full speed."</p>

<p>This they proceeded to do without further
delay. When it was no longer possible to utilize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
the bushes for cover, they sprang to their
feet and ran. Jack fully anticipated hearing
other shots&#8211;yes, and perhaps having more leaden
missiles singing their vicious songs about
his head. But he was agreeably disappointed
in his expectations, for not a report came.</p>

<p>Evidently the spy had gone away, thinking
discretion the better part of valor. He may
have noticed that they were in uniform, and
armed in the bargain.</p>

<p>Later on the air service boys moderated their
mad pace, and as there seemed to be no further
signs of danger they finally fell into a walk.
Still neither of them lagged, but kept up a brisk
pace, Jack casting numerous apprehensive
glances over his shoulder, haunted by a lingering
suspicion that the spy might yet give them
trouble.</p>

<p>They came through safely at last. The villa
in which the American fliers were quartered was
reached, and seemed to be deserted at that
hour in the afternoon. Everybody must be busy
at the front, the boys concluded, for the din
was more distracting than usual.</p>

<p>"We picked out a bad day for getting off,
I'm afraid, Tom," Jack sighed. "They told us
there was nothing big in prospect; but since
we started out on our hunt I guess the Huns
have put up something of size. And the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
will be in the thick of it all too! We might
have had a share if we'd been on duty to-day."</p>

<p>"Brace up, Jack," chided his chum. "For
all you know, what we've done may turn out
to be ten times more important than all the
work of the entire escadrille to-day. These
captured birds and that cipher message, represent
possibilities beyond anything you or I can
know. Leave all that to the general."</p>

<p>"When do you mean to see him, Tom?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I can arrange it. And you're
coming with me when I get the summons to
his headquarters, depend on that, Jack. Your
part in this affair is just as important as mine."</p>

<p>Tom put the cage with its cooing inmates
in their room. Then he started out to try to
get into communication with the commanding
general. He had met him once by mere chance,
but he hardly believed General Petain would
remember him in the least.</p>

<p>The action was about over for the day. The
Crown Prince had once again thrown a heavy
storming party forward in the endeavor to make
a breach in the French lines, through which
he could pour the veteran reserves he had in
waiting. But, as had often happened before,
he counted without his host; and when the sun
went down all he had to show for his stroke
was a greatly increased casualty list.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>The French could not be moved.</p>

<p>Tom understood how to go about it, and
in the end managed to get an obliging French
captain whom he knew very well, to carry a
message to the commander-in-chief to the effect
that he had news of great importance to communicate.
Just as Tom expected would be the
case, this brought back a speedy answer.</p>

<p>"You are both to come with me, young Messieurs,"
said the captain, his eyes sparkling with
interest, for Tom had told him enough to excite
his curiosity, and he knew the Americans would
not aimlessly take up the precious time of the
general. "Our valiant commander is tired after
a strenuous day; but never is he too weary to
attend to duty; and he already finds himself
interested in everything you brave young airmen
attempt. So please accompany me to headquarters."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the boys found themselves
face to face with General Petain.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PRAISE FROM THE GENERAL</span></h2>

<p>General Petain received the pair with his
accustomed kindness. He loved youth, and his
eyes sparkled with pleasure as he gave each of
them a hand.</p>

<p>"My time is limited, I regret to say, my
gallant Americans, or I should gladly ask you
all manner of questions concerning your own
country. We are all anxious to know when
the great republic across the sea will decide to
cast her decisive influence into the scales to
bring us the victory we await with much
patience. Tell me now what this strange thing
is you have come across to-day."</p>

<p>Tom waited for no second bidding. He realized
how tired the general must be after a
strenuous day in keeping his finger on the pulse
of the whole front, where the fierce German
attacks had been hurled without success.</p>

<p>Accordingly he started at once his tale of
how they had been given a day off for rest,
and, having a love for hunting in their veins,
had borrowed an old shotgun and started forth.
Without wasting any time in useless descriptions
he quickly reached the point where the
pigeon was shot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>Jack, having nothing to say just then, contented
himself with watching the various shades
of expression that flitted across the face of the
commander. At mention of the pigeon his
eyes sparkled, and he leaned forward with an
air of expectancy, as though anticipating what
would come next.</p>

<p>Then, as Tom produced the message written
on the thin but tough paper and handed it to
the general the French officer eagerly scanned
it. Jack also noticed that he did not appear
disappointed because he could not immediately
read the baffling communication. Of course
it would be written in some secret code; that
was to be expected.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate," remarked the French officer,
"that I have on my staff one who is considered
an expert at solving any and every species of
cipher code. He will speedily figure it all out
for me, and then we shall see what news this
spy was transmitting to his commander. Please
continue your story, which is very interesting,
and in which your part does you both credit."</p>

<p>Tom, thus encouraged, went on. He told
of their further search for the mysterious man
who had set the homing pigeon free after
attaching the secret message to it.</p>

<p>When he presently told of coming on the
ruined farmhouse, and discovering the ozier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
cage containing two additional pigeons, just
where the spy had left them in his hurried
flight, the general fairly beamed.</p>

<p>"It is splendid news you have brought me&#8211;you
aviators from our sister republic across the
sea," he remarked exultantly, as though already
in his fertile mind he could see great
possibilities looming up whereby those pigeons
might be made to serve a purpose.</p>

<p>The story was soon finished. Tom, of
course, thought it necessary to tell of having
been fired on while on their way back to the
aviation post, though no harm had resulted.
He did this not for the purpose of impressing
the general with the idea that they had run any
great personal risk, but because it might have
some influence on the plans the officer probably
had in mind.</p>

<p>After all had been told the commander again
shook hands with both of the air service boys.
This indicated, as Tom well knew, that he had
given them all the time he could spare and
that a dozen important things were awaiting
his attention, so he saluted and turned to
depart.</p>

<p>"This may prove to be a most important
thing you have discovered," the general halted
the aviators to say warmly. "The cipher will
be solved, and then, if the facts warrant it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
we may have another written that can be sent
forward by one of your birds. You will give
them over into the charge of an officer whom
I shall dispatch back with you to your quarters.
That will be convenient, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Tom hastened to assure him that they had
expected just such a thing, and had hoped that
the two captured pigeons might prove the
means of leading the Crown Prince's forces
into some sort of trap.</p>

<p>The general's black eyes snapped on hearing
Tom say this.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see that you too have thought it
out!" he exclaimed enthusiastically. "Some day
perhaps you may have command of an army,
and exercise that talent with glorious success.
France thanks you."</p>

<p>Both boys were deeply moved by their brief
interview with the busy commander-in-chief of
the French forces. They did not feel any humiliation
at being addressed as "my children,"
knowing that it was a term of endearment
used freely by officers high in command when
addressing, those in the ranks. In fact, the
French army is very much like a big family, the
men loving those they serve under.</p>

<p>"Well, that job's over," remarked Jack, heaving
a sigh of relief when they were on their
way to their quarters, accompanied by a jaunty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
captain who, Tom believed, must be a member
of the general's staff.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to have had such a fine opportunity
for meeting General Petain," Tom returned, for
the captain at the time was walking a little in
the rear, conversing with a courier who had
come running after him, as if on important
business.</p>

<p>"He was fine, wasn't he, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Next to Joffre I understand General Petain
is the most beloved commander the army has
ever had," replied the other. "I'll always feel
proud that he shook hands so heartily with
both of us."</p>

<p>The air service boys were soon in the automobile
that had carried them to the general's
headquarters back of the French lines. Here
the captain joined them, having finished his
hasty consultation with the courier. On the
ride to the aviation camp he chatted pleasantly
with the young Americans. He, it appeared,
had spent several years attached to the French
Embassy at Washington.</p>

<p>He asked particularly concerning the feeling
of the common people in America, and what
influence the powerful cliques of naturalized
but pro-German citizens were apt to have on
the Government.</p>

<p>Tom was able to assure him that slowly but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
surely the people of free America were becoming
aroused to the deadly menace of German
imperialism, and that presently&#8211;it might come
at any day, according to the latest advices&#8211;Congress
would assemble to hear a ringing appeal
from the President, urging them to declare
war upon the Kaiser, war to the finish.</p>

<p>Apparently what the boys said had much in
it to comfort the French captain. He knew
only too well how eagerly his wearied nation
was listening to hear just such a message of
hope. He knew, also, just what it would mean
for the brave defenders of France.</p>

<p>In due time the three arrived at the villa,
Several of the American pilots saw the trio
leave the car, wondered much what was in
the wind that Tom and Jack should return
with a member of General Petain's personal
staff. Their curiosity was considerably heightened
when later they saw the captain come
out of the villa carrying a small ozier cage
containing two blue-rock carrier pigeons, and effusively
shake hands with both Tom and Jack,
calling out to them as the car moved off:</p>

<p>"In the name of France and General Petain
I thank you for what you have done this day,
my brave Americans!"</p>

<p>As the chums were about to pass into the
building there was a hail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>"Wait a minute, Jack!" called one of their
fellow pilots, hurrying up with some object in
his hand at which the two boys stared with
rising curiosity. "I've got something here for
you!"</p>

<p>"For me?" cried the youth addressed. "I'm
ever so much obliged, but it strikes me I've
got beyond the point of playing with a toy
balloon; though honestly now, when I was a
kid I used to be pretty fond of sailing one of
'em at the end of a long string, until it would
get away, and leave me staring up while it
climbed toward the clouds."</p>

<p>"Oh, this one is about past doing any climbing,
I should say," replied the pilot, laughing
at Jack's description of his childish woes. "In
fact, it's been out during the night, and the
heavy air forced it to come down. Listen, and
I'll tell you a strange story that will make you
believe in fairy tales."</p>

<p>"Go on then, please," urged Jack. "You've
got me all worked up already. So there's a
history attached to this little balloon, is there?"</p>

<p>"There was <i>something</i> attached to it, something
that may mean much or little to you
fellows," came the reply. "This thing was found
by a French dispatch bearer on his way across
country. Out of curiosity he stepped aside to
look at the bobbing red object he had noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
among some bushes in an open field. When
he found that it had a paper fastened to it,
which on the outside had an address, he concluded
to bring the whole business along with
him. He came here half an hour back inquiring
for Jack Parmly, and on finding you were away
at the time left the balloon and the paper in
my charge. Take it, and see what the message
is, Jack!"</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STRANGE WARNING</span></h2>

<p>"Open it, Jack, and see what the message
is," urged Tom, as his chum stood with the
scrap of damp paper held between his fingers,
having allowed the sagging little toy balloon
to fall at his feet.</p>

<p>Jack was thinking just at that moment of
the other message his companion and he had
found attached to the homing pigeon. But
of course they could not possibly have any
sort of connection!</p>

<p>He opened the small bit of paper. It had
some writing in lead pencil. Once it had doubtless
been plain enough, but the dampness must
have caused it to become faint. Still, Jack
could make it out without much difficulty. This
was what he read aloud, so that Tom and the
other pilot could hear:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>"<i>Look carefully to your planes; examine every
part. There is treachery in the air!</i>"</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>"That's all, fellows," said Jack, much puzzled,
as he turned the paper over and over, looking
for some signature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>"No name attached, Jack?" asked his chum.</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever to tell who wrote that
warning. Here, take a look at it, Tom. Your
eyes may be sharper than mine and see something
I've missed."</p>

<p>But Tom and the other pilot both failed to
throw any light on the matter after examining
the paper thoroughly. They exchanged stares.
Then Jack laughed, a little queerly.</p>

<p>"This is certainly a mystery," he went on to
say, trying to take the thing as a joke. "Some
kind friend sends me a solemn warning, and
then neglects to sign his name. Do you think
any of the fellows of the escadrille could be
up to a prank?"</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. The other pilot also
exhibited positive signs of doubt in connection
with such a thing.</p>

<p>"The boys often have their little jokes, and
we are a merry bunch much of the time, just
to change off from the nervous strain we're
living under," the man observed. "But I'm
sure not one of them would dream of doing a
thing like this. It would be a mean trick."</p>

<p>"Then both of you are inclined to believe this
warning was meant in all seriousness, are you?"
continued Jack, no longer grinning as before.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," Tom instantly announced. "It
seems a bit childish, sending it in such a queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
fashion; but then perhaps it was the only way
open to the person. There was one chance in
ten that it would be found; but you know sometimes
we can't choose our way of doing things,
but must accommodate ourselves to circumstances.
This toy balloon being handy suggested
a possible way of getting the warning to you,
Jack."</p>

<p>"But why me any more than you, Tom, or
any other fellow in the escadrille?" continued
Jack, sorely bewildered.</p>

<p>"That's something we can only guess at," he
was told. "Evidently this person had your name,
and knew you were working here with the
Lafayette boys. Try to think of some one you
may have done something for to make him
feel grateful to you. Could it have been that
boyish-looking German prisoner we talked with
the other day, and for whom you bound up a
badly damaged arm, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that boy!" exclaimed the other, and
then shook his head. "No, it's impossible. You
see the poor chap could hardly talk halfway
decent English, and I'm sure he never could
write my name like this. Besides, Tom," Jack
went on triumphantly, "I never bothered to
mention to him that I had a name. To him I
was simply an American flying for France."</p>

<p>"Anybody else you can think of?" persisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
Tom, for it seemed to him that it meant considerable
to try to discover who had sent the
message by such a strange channel.</p>

<p>Jack pondered. Then all at once he looked
up with a light in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You've thought of something!" exclaimed
the other pilot eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, it might be possible, although I
hardly believe she'd be the one to go to such
trouble. Still, she had children, she told me,
at her home in Lorraine, back of Metz; and
this is a child's toy, this little hot-air balloon."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that woman you assisted a
week or so ago? Mrs. Neumann?" asked Tom,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was only a little thing I was able to
do for her, but she seemed grateful, and said
she hoped some day to be in a position to repay
the favor. Then later on I learned she had
secured permission to cross over to the German
lines, in order to get to her family. She is a
widow with six children, you know, a native of
Lorraine, and caught by accident in one of the
sudden furious rushes of the French, so that she
had been carried back with them when they
retreated. At the time she had been serving
as a Red Cross nurse among the Germans. It
was on that account the French allowed her to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
return to her family. They are very courteous,
these French."</p>

<p>Tom was listening. He nodded his head as
though it seemed promising at least.</p>

<p>"Let's figure it out," he mused. "Which way
was the wind coming from last night, do either
of you happen to know?"</p>

<p>"Almost from the north," the other aviator
instantly responded. "I chanced to notice that
fact, for other reasons. But then it was almost
still, so the little balloon could not have drifted
many miles before the heavy atmosphere
dragged it down until finally it landed in the
field."</p>

<p>"Well, that settles one thing," asserted Tom.
"It came from back of the German lines, don't
you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that seems probable," admitted Jack.</p>

<p>"Your unknown friend was there at the time,"
continued Tom, in his lawyer-like way, following
up the trail he had started; "and hence
apparently in a position to know that some sort
of plot was being engineered against one Jack
Parmly. Don't ask me why <i>you</i> should be
selected for any rank treachery, because I don't
know."</p>

<p>"And this person, this unknown friend of
mine," Jack added, "wishing to warn me so that
I might not meet a bad end to-day, sent out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
this message in the hope that it might fall back
of our lines and be picked up. Tom, it makes
me have a queer feeling. I almost think I must
be asleep and dreaming."</p>

<p>"No, it's real enough. We may never know
who the writer of this note is; but we can heed
the warning just the same, and go over to
examine our planes minutely. Whoever it was,
spelled your name correctly. I've studied the
writing, but it seems to be assumed, and clumsy.
There was a reason for that too, as well as the
writer failing to sign a name."</p>

<p>"What sort of reason?" queried Jack.</p>

<p>"Fear that in some way the message, and the
balloon, might fall into German hands and lead
to unpleasant results," Tom continued. "We
know about how those Huns would serve any
one who tried to spoil their plans. They believe
in frightfulness every time, and it might mean
death to the writer. This she evidently knew
full well."</p>

<p>"Just why do you say 'she' when you speak
of the writer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have an idea that Mrs. Neumann may
be the mysterious friend who is taking such
desperate chances to send you a warning. Anyway,
something about it seems to say it isn't a
man's handwriting. Besides, neither of you may
have noticed it, but there's a faint odor, as of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
perfume, adheres to that bit of paper, though
the dampness has taken it almost all out."</p>

<p>Jack looked astonished at such shrewd reasoning.</p>

<p>"Well, you are certainly a wonder at seeing
through things, Tom," he hastened to say. "And
so of course that settles it in my mind. Mrs.
Neumann sent this message to me; though how
she could have learned that there was anything
treacherous going on beats my powers of
reasoning."</p>

<p>"But don't you think it would pay to learn
if there's any truth about it all?" asked the
other pilot, whose curiosity had been stirred up
by such a strange happening.</p>

<p>"Yes, let's all go over to the hangars and
have the planes out for a regular inspection,"
said Tom. "If mischief has been done the
chances are it would be in a part not usually
examined by the mechanician before a flight.
Then again the damage, if there is any, might
be so covered up by the shrewd schemer that
it would not be noticeable."</p>

<p>There were always cars going to and fro, for
pilots came and went from time to time; so the
trio quickly found themselves being whirled
along over the road so often traveled in their
daily work.</p>

<p>"How about that fellow they chased late yesterday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
afternoon, who was loitering about the
hangars and acting in a suspicious way?" asked
the friendly pilot, as they rode along. "More
than a few of the fellows say he must have
been a spy, and up to some mischief, because
he slipped off so slickly."</p>

<p>"I had him in mind all the while," said Tom.
"And if any mischief has been done, of course
we can lay it at his door; though just how he
managed to work we'll perhaps never know."</p>

<p>"I caught sight of him, too," Jack remarked;
"and I only wish now I'd had a good look at
the chap who owned those pigeons to-day, so
as to tell if they were one and the same, which
I believe to be a fact."</p>

<p>Just then Tom gave his chum a kick with the
toe of his shoe. This suddenly reminded Jack
that he was treading on forbidden ground, since
they had resolved not to say anything to a
third person concerning the adventure of that
afternoon.</p>

<p>The other member of the escadrille was looking
interested. He understood that Tom and
Jack must have met with some singular adventure;
but since they did not see fit to take him
into their confidence he was too polite to ask
questions, feeling there must be a good reason
for their silence.</p>

<p>Presently they arrived at the hangars. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
now almost sunset. The fliers were coming
down one by one, their labor for the day having
been accomplished. It had been a pretty arduous
day, too, and two members of the escadrille
had new honors coming to them, since they had
dropped enemy planes in full view of tens of
thousands of cheering spectators, after thrilling
combats high in the air.</p>

<p>One had also passed through an experience
that few aviators can look back to. He had
started to drop rapidly when, at almost ten
thousand feet altitude, his motor was struck by a
missile from a rival pilot's gun. When halfway
down, either through a freak of fortune or
some wonderfully clever manipulation on the
part of the pilot, the machine righted, and he
was enabled to volplane to safety, though
considerably bruised and cut up through hasty
landing.</p>

<p>Jack quickly had his little Nieuport out of the
hangar, and the three airmen began a minute
inspection. For a short time nothing developed
that had a suspicious appearance. Jack, in fact,
was beginning to believe the warning might
after all be in the nature of a fake, or else the
spy had not found a favorable chance to do his
foul work before being frightened off.</p>

<p>But presently Tom gave utterance to an exclamation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>"Found anything, Tom?" asked Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Come around here, both of you!"</p>

<p>When the others joined Tom he pointed to
where an important wire stay had been dextrously
filed so that it must snap under a severe
wrench or strain, such as commonly comes when
a pilot is far afield, and wishes to execute a
necessary whirl.</p>

<p>Jack shivered as he took in the meaning of
that partly severed stay. If it gave way while
he was far above the earth it must spell his
certain doom!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>LOOKING BACKWARD</span></h2>

<p>"Just see the fiendish cleverness of the fellow
who filed that stay!" Tom cried, as they all
stared. "He filled the indentation his sharp file
made with a bit of wax or chewing-gum of the
same general color. Why, no one would ever
have noticed the least thing wrong when making
the ordinary examination."</p>

<p>"Then how did you manage to find it, Tom?"
asked Jack, breathing hard, as he pictured to
himself the narrow escape he had had.</p>

<p>"I suspected something of the kind might be
done; so I ran my thumb-nail down each wire
stay," came the answer. "And it turned out
just as I thought."</p>

<p>"There may be still more places filed in the
same way," suggested the other pilot, looking
as black as a thunder-cloud; because such an
act was in his mind the rankest sort of treachery,
worthy of only the most degraded man.</p>

<p>"We will find them if there are," replied Tom,
resolutely. "And when this thing is known I
imagine there'll be a general overhauling of all
the machines on the aviation field. One thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
is certain, Jack. You were playing in great luck
when you suggested that we ask for a day off
and then picked out this particular one."</p>

<p>Jack shrugged his shoulders as he replied:</p>

<p>"That's right, Tom."</p>

<p>Nothing could be done just then, with night
coming on. Tom talked with several of the
attendants at the hangars, and left it to them to
go to work with the coming of morning. He
even showed them how cunningly the work had
been carried out; so they might be on their
guard against such a trick from that time
forward.</p>

<p>Then the three returned to the villa. Others
of the members of the escadrille were in the car
with the trio, so the talk was general, experiences
of the day's happenings being narrated,
all told in a careless fashion, as if those young
aviators considered all such risks as part of the
ordinary routine of business.</p>

<p>Later on the news concerning Jack's singular
warning, and what came of it went the rounds.
He was asked to show the brief note many
times; but in answer to the questions that came
pouring in upon him, Jack could not say more
than he had already said with regard to his
suspicions concerning the probable writer of the
message.</p>

<p>That night Tom and Jack preferred the quiet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
of their own apartment to the general sitting-room,
where the tired pilots gathered to smoke,
talk, play games, sing, and give their opinions
on every topic imaginable, including scraps of
news received in late letters from home towns
across the sea.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Tom," Jack said unexpectedly;
"I'd give something to know where Bessie
Gleason is just at this time. It's strange how
often I think about that young girl. It's just
as if something that people call intuition told
me she might be in serious trouble through that
hard-looking guardian of hers, Carl Potzfeldt."</p>

<p>Tom smiled.</p>

<p>Bessie Gleason was a very pretty and winsome
girl of about twelve years of age, with whom
Jack in particular had been quite "chummy" on
the voyage across the Atlantic, and through the
submarine zone, as related in "Air Service Boys
Flying for France." The last he had seen of her
was when she waved her hand to him when
leaving the steamer at its English port. Her
stern guardian had contracted a violent dislike
for Jack, so that the two had latterly been
compelled to meet only in secret for little
confidential chats.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've taken to imagining all sorts of
terrible things in connection with pretty Bessie
and her cruel guardian. He claimed to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
Swiss, or a native of Alsace-Lorraine, which was
it, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," murmured Jack Parmly, his
thoughts just then far away from Tom and his
question, though fixed on Carl Potzfeldt and
his young ward.</p>

<p>Bessie Gleason was a little American girl, a
child of moods, fairylike in appearance and of a
maturity of manner that invariably attracted
those with whom she came in contact.</p>

<p>Her mother had been lost at sea, and by Mrs.
Gleason's will the girl and her property were
left in Potzfeldt's care. Mr. Potzfeldt was taking
her to Europe, and on the steamship she and
Jack Parmly had been friends, and as Potzfeldt's
actions were suspicious and, moreover, the girl
did not seem happy with him Jack had been
troubled about her.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you think too much about Bessie
and her troubles, Jack; and get yourself worked
up about things that may never happen to her,"
Tom went on after a pause.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd say that, Tom," the other told
him reproachfully. "But I'm not blaming you
for it. However, there are several things Bessie
told me that I haven't mentioned to you before;
and they help to make me feel anxious about
her happiness. She's a queer girl, you know,
and intensely patriotic."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>"Yes I noticed that, even if you did monopolize
most of her time," chuckled Tom.</p>

<p>"How she does hate the Germans, though!
And that's what will get her into trouble I'm
afraid, if she and her guardian have managed
to get through the lines in any way, and back
to his home town, wherever that may be."</p>

<p>"Why should she feel so bitter toward the
Kaiser and his people, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. Her mother was drowned. She
was aboard the <i>Lusitania</i>, and was never seen
after the sinking. Mr. Potzfeldt was there too,
it seems, but couldn't save Mrs. Gleason, he
claims, though he tried in every way to do so.
She was a distant relative of his, you remember."</p>

<p>"Then if Bessie knows about her mother's
death," Tom went on to say, "I don't wonder
she feels that way toward everything German.
I'd hate the entire race if my mother had been
murdered, as those women and children were,
when that torpedo was launched against the
great passenger steamer without any warning."</p>

<p>"She told me she felt heart-broken because
she was far too young to do anything to assist
in the drive against the central empires. You
see, Bessie has great hopes of some day growing
tall enough to become a war nurse. She is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
deeply interested in the Red Cross; and Tom,
would you believe it, the midget practices regular
United States Army standing exercises in
the hope of hastening her growth."</p>

<p>"I honor the little girl for her ambition,"
Tom said. "But I'm inclined to think this war
will be long past before she has grown to a
suitable size to enlist among the nurses of the
Paris hospitals. And if that Carl Potzfeldt entertains
the sentiments we suspected him of, and
is secretly in sympathy with the Huns, although
passing for a neutral, her task will be rendered
doubly hard."</p>

<p>"That's what makes me feel bad every time
I get to thinking of Bessie. If only we could
chance to run across them again I'd like to
engineer some scheme by which she could be
taken away from her guardian. For instance,
if only it could be proved that Potzfeldt was in
the pay of the German Government, don't you
see he could be stood up against a wall, and
fixed; and then some one would be found able
and willing to take care of the girl."</p>

<p>Tom laughed again.</p>

<p>"How nicely you make your arrangements,
Jack! Very pleasant outlook for poor Mr.
Potzfeldt, I should say. Why, you hustle him off
this earth just as if he didn't matter thirty
cents."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>"It isn't because I'm heartless," expostulated
the other hurriedly. "But I'm sure that dark-faced
man is a bad egg. We suspected him of
being hand-in-glove with Adolph Tuessig, the
man who stole your father's invention, and who
we knew was a hired German spy over in America.
And from little hints Bessie dropped once
in a while I am certain he doesn't treat her
well."</p>

<p>"Still, we can't do the least thing about it,
Jack. If fortune should ever bring us in contact
with that pair again, why then we could perhaps
think up some sort of scheme to help
Bessie. Now, I've got something important to
tell you."</p>

<p>"Something the captain must have said when
he was chatting with you in the mess-room
immediately after supper, I guess. At the time I
thought he might be asking you about our
adventures of to-day, but then I noticed that he
was doing pretty much all the talking. What is
on the carpet for us now?"</p>

<p>"We're going to be given our chance at last,
Jack!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to fly with the fighting
escadrille, and meet German pilots in a life and
death battle up among the clouds?" asked Jack,
in a voice that had a tinge of awe about it; for
he had often dreamed of such honors coming to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
him; but the realization still seemed afar off.</p>

<p>"That is what we are promised," his chum
assured him. "Of course our education is not
yet complete; but we have shown such progress
that, as there is need of additional pilots able
to meet the Fokker planes while a raid is in
progress, we are to be given a showing."</p>

<p>"I'll not sleep much to-night for thinking of
it," declared Jack.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GREAT DAY ARRIVES</span></h2>

<p>By the time the pilots of the American
escadrille began to assemble on the field where
the airplane hangars were clustered, (these
being more or less camouflaged by means of
paint cleverly applied to represent the earth),
the news concerning the air service boys' narrow
escape had become generally known.</p>

<p>Great was the indignation expressed by all.
Up to this time there had appeared to be considerable
honor exhibited among-the flying men
on both sides. In fact many curious little courtesies
had been exchanged that seemed to put
the aviation service on a plane of its own.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. After that there would
be no taking things for granted. Each pilot
meant to satisfy himself as best he could that
his plane was in perfect order before risking
his life in the upper currents.</p>

<p>Jack was besieged for a full account of the
matter. He, being an obliging person, gladly
told everything he knew. Naturally the mystery
attached to the discovery of the message of
warning tied to the poor little partly collapsed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
child's balloon aroused considerable curiosity
and speculation among the aviators.</p>

<p>The way some of them pumped Jack made
him laugh; but he assured them he was just
about as "deep in the mud as they were in the
mire."</p>

<p>"I've told you all about the woman named
Mrs. Neumann," he repeated for the tenth time.
"And she's the only one I can think of who
would be apt to care a cent whether Jack
Parmly happened to be alive or dead. If anybody
can give a better guess I'd like to hear it."</p>

<p>They did considerable "guessing," but after
all it became the consensus of opinion that the
grateful Mrs. Neumann was responsible. And
so finally they let it go at that; for the day had
begun, and there was an abundance of work to
be accomplished before the sun set again.</p>

<p>"But this is certain," said one of the leading
flyers of the escadrille, seriously; "if the Boches
mean to stop playing fair it's bound to demoralize
the service. Up to now there's been an
unwritten set of rules to the game, which both
sides have lived up to. I shall hate to see
them discarded, and brutal methods put in their
place."</p>

<p>Others were of the opinion that there might
have been something personal connected with the
attempt to kill Jack, through that shabby trick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
The German spy might have had a private grievance
against the youth, they said, which he
meant to pay off in his own dastardly way.</p>

<p>No matter which turned out to be the truth,
it was not pleasant for Jack to believe he had
become an object of hatred to some mysterious
prowler, and that possibly other secret attempts
on his life might be made from time to time.</p>

<p>That day passed, and another followed.
There did not seem to be much stirring on
either side of the line; but such a lull frequently
proved the precursor of some gigantic battle,
for which the armies were preparing.</p>

<p>Of course, when the wind and weather permitted,
there was always plenty of excitement
among the airplane escadrilles. All manner of
little expeditions were organized and carried
out.</p>

<p>Now it was an attempt to get above that
string of "sausage" balloons used for observation
purposes only, so that a few well-dropped
bombs might play havoc among them.</p>

<p>As these were always defended by a force of
fighting planes hovering above, all primed to
give battle on the slightest provocation, the
result of these forays was that a number of
hotly-contested fights were "pulled off" high in
air.</p>

<p>One pilot brought down another enemy, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
increased his score a peg, always a matter of
pride with a pilot of a fighting plane. And
another of the escadrille had the honor of getting
above those observation balloons before a
couple of them could be hastily pulled down.</p>

<p>Two of his companions engaged the defending
Teuton pilots, and fended them off purposely,
in order to permit the raid. The selected
man swooped down like a hawk, passed the
Gotha guard, and managed to shoot his bomb
downward with unerring aim. One of the balloons
was seen to burst into flames, and the
second must have met with a like fate, since it
was perilously near at the time, though the
dense smoke obscured everything.</p>

<p>All these things and more did Tom and Jack
witness through their glasses as those two days
passed. Tom especially was waiting to have his
wish realized with as much calmness as he could
summon.</p>

<p>"I think it will come to-night, Jack," he told
his chum, on the second afternoon, as they prepared
to return to their lodgings.</p>

<p>"Then you believe there's some big move on
tap, and that to-morrow a battle will be commenced?
And all for the possession of some old
ruined fort, perhaps, that is now only a mass of
crumpled masonry and debris!"</p>

<p>"You mustn't forget, Jack, it is the famous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
name that counts with these romantic Frenchmen.
Douaumont and Vaux mean everything
to them, even if there is nothing but a great
mound of stone, mortar and earth to tell where
each fort once stood."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you're right, Tom; and then
again I was forgetting that the retaking of a
prominent position which the Germans had captured
means a heartening of the whole army.
I've heard them talking of Mort-Homme, and
Hill Three Hundred and Four, as if those were
the most precious bits of territory in all France."</p>

<p>"These are sometimes strategic points, you
know, keys to a further advance. But there
comes the captain now, and he's got his eye
on us, as sure as you live!" ejaculated Tom,
giving a little start, and turning a shade paler
than usual, owing to the excess of his emotions,
and the anticipation of hearing pleasant news.</p>

<p>The leader of the Lafayette Escadrille smiled
as he drew near. He waited until he could
speak without being overheard, for it was not
always wise to shout aloud when dealing with
matters in which the High Command had a
deep interest, such as a pending advance movement.</p>

<p>"It is to-morrow, Raymond," he said quietly,
yet with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>He had taken a great liking to these daring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
lads who had already made such strides toward
the goal of becoming "aces" in time, granting
that they lived through the risky period of their
apprenticeship.</p>

<p>"Both?" gasped Jack eagerly.</p>

<p>The head pilot shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint you, Parmly, but you'll
have to wait a bit longer," he announced,
whereat the other's face fell again, though he
gulped, and tried to appear content. "There
are several things you must correct before you
can expect to take such chances. We are short
a fighting pilot for to-morrow, and I thought
it was time we gave Raymond his initiation."</p>

<p>Then as he walked alongside the chums he
entered into a minute description of the duties
that would devolve upon Tom in his first time
up to serve as a guardian to the heavier planes
acting as "fire-control" and scouts, or "eyes of
the army."</p>

<p>"Of course you are only to butt in if we are
outnumbered," the leader explained in conclusion.
"The experienced and able fliers must take
care of such of the enemy as venture to attack
our big machines. Some of these Boches will
be their best men, with records of a dozen or
two machines to their credit. It would be little
short of suicide to send a novice up against
them, you understand."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>Tom was ambitious, and would of course be
delighted to prove his metal when opposed by
a famous "ace;" whose name and reputation
had long made him a terror to the French and
British airmen. Nevertheless he recognized the
wisdom of what the captain was telling him,
and promised to restrain his eagerness until
given the prearranged signal that his chance
had come.</p>

<p>It made Tom feel proud to know he had
won the good opinion of such a brave man as
the captain, as well as the friendship of those
other gallant souls composing the American
squadron of aviators fighting for France.</p>

<p>"Still," he said to Jack later on, when they
were together in their room getting into their
ordinary street clothes, "it made me feel a bit
cheap when he spoke of my being pitted against
just an <i>ordinary</i> pilot, some fresh hand as
anxious as we are to achieve a reputation. At
the same time that's what we must seem to
these veterans of scores of air combats, all of
whom have met with the most thrilling adventures
again and again."</p>

<p>Jack managed to hide his bitter disappointment.
He realized that he would never be in
the same class as his more brilliant chum. Tom
fitted for becoming an expert in the line
had chosen for his calling. On the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
hand Jack began to believe that he was a little
too slow-witted ever to make a shining success
as a fighting aviator, where skill must be backed
by astonishing quickness of mind and body, as
well as <i>something else</i> within the heart that is
an inherited birthright.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he consoled himself by saying,
not aloud, but softly, "I can be the pilot of
a bombing machine, and perhaps in time they'll
give me charge of a plane used as fire-control
during the battle. That is as far up the pole
as I ought to aspire to climb. These chaps in
the Lafayette are one and all picked men, the
very cream of the entire service."</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>OVER THE ENEMY'S LINES</span></h2>

<p>"I say, Tom, it looks like a poor day for
flying I'm afraid," Jack called out in the chill
of the early dawn the next morning, he having
been the first to get out of bed and step over
to the window of their sleeping room.</p>

<p>It was of course in the villa placed at the
disposal of the escadrille, many miles back of
the first line of trenches.</p>

<p>Tom, however, did not bother his head about
the weather to any appreciable extent.</p>

<p>"It's likely to turn out a fair day for work,"
he told his chum, in his cheery way, as he followed
Jack to the window. "You know that's
happened lots of times. So far we've been lucky
enough not to get caught in a storm while
aloft. Yes, I can already see that there isn't
going to be a stiff breeze; and what would a
sprinkle of rain amount to?"</p>

<p>"I suppose the thing has to be pulled off,
no matter what the weather is," mused Jack,
as he proceeded to dress, since breakfast had
been ordered at an unusually early hour that
morning.</p>

<p>"Well, the High Command has made all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
arrangements for a big time. You know what
that means, when tens of thousands of poilus
have to be transferred during the darkness of
night, so that the enemy pilots can't glimpse
the movement and give warning? So, unless
the skies fall, we are bound to get busy this
morning."</p>

<p>The air service boys were soon at the hangars,
where an animated scene was taking place. Any
one could see that something unusual was
about to take place, because of the numbers of
men rushing this way and that, while motors
were popping and machine-guns being tried out
so as to be certain they were in prime condition
for service. Scores of mechanicians, chauffeurs,
observers, as well as other helpers, went about
their work of getting "ready for business."</p>

<p>The air fighters were dressed in their fur-lined
union suits, with fur overcoats, gloves,
and caps; for they would soon be soaring to
great heights, where the atmosphere was almost
Arctic in its intensity.</p>

<p>They were examining their automatic pistols,
seeing that their airplane compasses, speed indicators,
special airplane clocks, mounted on
wire springs, and altitude barometers were in
their proper places and in working order.
Their very lives might depend on a little thing,
and no one could afford to neglect even trifles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>Every few minutes one of the planes would
roll over the surface of the level ground in front
of the long line of hangars. Then, when sufficient
momentum had been attained, it would
commence to climb swiftly upward. Soon the
machine would get into spirals like a winding
staircase, and mount toward an altitude of perhaps
four thousand feet, there to await the coming
of companion craft before heading toward
the battleground, far distant.</p>

<p>Jack squeezed the hand of his chum, and gave
him one last look. There was no need of words
to tell the deep feelings that gripped his loyal
heart; indeed, Jack was utterly unable to utter
a single sentence.</p>

<p>Then Tom was off.</p>

<p>He made the ascent with his customary
brilliancy, which had won him the admiration
of the entire escadrille. The air seemed to be
filled with various types of planes. Some were
already moving off toward the front, from which
came the roar of battle, showing that already
the action had begun by an intense bombardment
of a portion of the German trenches which
the French longed to retake.</p>

<p>Tom spent some little time "knocking
around" while awaiting the coming of those
members of the Lafayette Escadrille who were
the last to leave the ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>What is twenty or even thirty miles to a pilot
in a speedy Neiuport capable of going two
miles a minute when pressed? They could be
over the lines in a very brief time after leaving
the aviation camp.</p>

<p>Tom looked at the scene below him, which
was spread out like a gigantic map. He never
wearied of observing it when simply "loafing"
up in the air, as at present. The sun was fairly
above the eastern horizon, though clouds drifted
along in scattered masses, and it was as yet
impossible to tell what the day might bring
forth.</p>

<p>Then the last of the squadron arrived, and
the signal was given to start for the front. Away
they went with a whirr and a roar, seven strong.
They overtook a number of clumsy two-seaters
on the way, observation planes, bombing
machines, or it might be those included in the
"fire-control" units going to relieve some of
their kind already doing their appointed bit in
the battle.</p>

<p>Tom looked far beyond. He could see great
oceans of smoke arising that told of innumerable
high explosives bursting, and enormous
guns being discharged. Both sides seemed hard
at work, though the French were certainly sending
ten shells to one that came from the forces
of the Crown Prince. This told plainly enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
which army expected to do the attacking that
day.</p>

<p>And yet while all this wonderful panorama
of war was spread beneath them, the seven
pilots moving onward in wild-geese formation,
with the captain at the head of the V, they heard
nothing of the tumult raging. In their muffled
ears sounded only the loud whirr of the propellers,
and the deafening explosions of the
engines. It was almost as noisy as a boiler shop
in full blast.</p>

<p>The fire-control planes were already sending
back their signals, the observer aboard intently
following the course of each monster shell to
note exactly where it landed, and then communicating
with the gunners, so they might
correct their faults and make each missile count.</p>

<p>German pilots were in the air also, sometimes
in swarms. Theirs was the task to attack these
heavier machines and try to cripple or destroy
them.</p>

<p>Of course each one of these machines of the
French "relage," or fire-control, was armed
with a quick-firing gun; and there was an observer
aboard, as well as a deft pilot. They
carried such a large assortment of material, consisting
among other things of a complete wireless
outfit, that they had to be built with unusually
large wings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>This makes them slow to answer to the call
of the pilot; and when attacked by the more
nimble Fokkers they have a hard time to keep
from being shot down. That is why a number
of the Nieuports with well known "aces" in
charge, must always be hovering over the fire
controls, ready to fly to their assistance in case
they are attacked.</p>

<p>"Things are surely beginning to happen,"
murmured Tom. "The Boches seem to be in
an unusually fierce and aggressive humor on
this particular morning."</p>

<p>The youth was right in this. The Germans
had been thrown out of numerous hard-won
positions lately, and this gave them cause for
feeling bitterly toward the French.</p>

<p>By the time the American unit reached the
field of battle, several furious combats had
already taken place with disastrous results. Two
of the enemy machines had been sent down,
one of them in flames, after the pilot had fallen
at his post, fairly riddled by the gunfire of the
Frenchman. A birdman had also paid the great
debt on the side of Petain's men. As the score
was two against one there seemed no cause for
depression.</p>

<p>The Americans would not be kept out of the
fight for long. No sooner were three adventurous
Teuton pilots seen climbing up to attack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
the big fire control machine when Tom's companions
dropped down from the "ceiling" to
engage them.</p>

<p>Tom watched everything as though photographing
the thrilling happenings on his brain
forever. He had a greater interest in these
things than at any previous period of his life,
for was he not also hovering over that observation
Caudron, upon which the movements of
the advancing French troops depended? At
any minute might he not receive the signal from
the captain to attack some fresh Boche, who
had climbed high above the battle lines to join
the general scrimmage, or else "get" the big
French machine while its defenders had their
hands full with his comrades?</p>

<p>Had Tom been able to use his binoculars
just then, which was out of the question of
course, and look back to where the monster
French guns were firing, he might have noticed
various white sheets spread out in fantastic patterns
on the ground, the picture varying every
little while.</p>

<p>These were used to "talk" with the observer
who was sending those messages from the fire-control
plane, telling the gunners just how many
metres their fire was short, long, to the right,
or to the left of their intended objective.</p>

<p>Then again information was being sent by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
another observer to the advancing infantry,
warning them of perils that lay in their way,
which might have cost them great and grievous
losses if they remained unknown until the German
trap was sprung.</p>

<p>The morning was advancing. Tom had seen
his comrades chase off several flocks of enemy
aircraft that endeavored to interrupt the deadly
work of the observers. As yet his anticipated
chance had not come. He was beginning to feel
impatient. Could it be that he must stay there
almost up among the clouds, and only be a
"looker-on?"</p>

<p>How eagerly did his heart throb with renewed
hope each time he discovered signs of
another attempt on the part of the enemy pilots
to engineer a raid that might check this observation
work. They knew what it was doing to
advance the cause of the battling French; and
that, as often proved to be the case, the airplanes
were again the "vigilant eyes of the
army."</p>

<p>It was well along in the morning when Tom
Raymond's time came. The fighting below had
been going on for some time, and from fugitive
glimpses Tom snatched every now and then as
he looked down, he had reason to believe things
were moving successfully for the assailants. At
least the French troops occupied a long line of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
trenches where the Boches had been in possession
at the close of the previous day.</p>

<p>Yes, there was another burst of ambitious
fliers rising to take a chance. The fact that
already seven of their men had been dropped,
several with their planes ablaze, did not deter
them; for those German airmen had often
proved their courage and were known as
stubborn fighters.</p>

<p>Soon another battle below the clouds was in
progress. Besides Tom, there were now only
three of the Americans in the air, the remainder
having been driven down, some in trouble of
some kind, others to replenish their supplies.
And there were <i>four</i> enemy planes, Tom
noticed, even as he watched the machine of the
captain and received the signal to attack the
latest arrival in the enemy squadron.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>WINNING HIS SPURS</span></h2>

<p>"At last!"</p>

<p>Those were the expressive words that broke
from Tom Raymond's lips when he saw the
commander give him the long-anticipated
signal. Tom had already discovered his intended
antagonist. A fourth plane was coming
up quickly. It had held back to await the chance
that would be offered when the three defenders
of the fire-control machine were hotly engaged
with the trio of skillful Boche pilots.</p>

<p>The game was very apparent. It was likewise
exceedingly old. The French commander was
too experienced an aviator to be so easily
caught. That was why he had signaled to Tom
to take care of the fourth and last German
airman, and guard the important observation
plane.</p>

<p>Tom started down with a rush, just as a
hungry hawk might swoop upon a pigeon it
had marked for its intended prey.</p>

<p>"I've got to make good!" the young aviator
told himself. "I've got to make good!"</p>

<p>The German pilot saw him coming. He had
more than half expected to be interfered with
in his designs; but it would please him first of
all to riddle this ambitious young airman, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
his Nieuport, and then to accomplish his main
purpose.</p>

<p>Now the two were so close that Tom could
plainly see the black Maltese crosses on the
wings of the Teuton plane as it tilted in climbing.
Already had the other opened fire on him,
for as his motor was silent during his first long
dive Tom could catch the tut-tut-tut of the
rapidly exploding mitrailleuse.</p>

<p>Somehow this did not unnerve him in the
least, as he had feared it might. Even when
he realized that the missiles were cutting holes
through the wings a few feet away he did not
grow uneasy. The spirit of battle had gripped
Tom. He was now attaining what had seemed
to be the height of his ambition. He was trying
out his mettle against one of the enemy pilots,
a man with considerable more experience than
himself, and therefore well fitted to spur him
on to do his level best.</p>

<p>He could see the pilot crouched in his place,
and working his gun with one hand while he
managed some controls of his fleeting machine
with the other, for there was only one man
aboard, though German machines usually hold
two. Long practice had made him an adept
at this sort of thing, it seemed.</p>

<p>But then Tom had been taught the same
clever trick down at the French school of aviation
at Pau, and over on the lake at Casso. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
was now about to show whether he had learned
his lesson to advantage. It was French ways
pitted against those of the German school.</p>

<p>Tom tried to aim directly at the foeman as
he rushed toward him. Then he pressed the
release hard, and instantly the rapid-fire gun
commenced its staccato barking, as it spit out
the bullets.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! crack!</p>

<p>Thus the two rivals, rushing at each other
like opposing birds of enormous size, passed
and dived, as though ducking to avoid the hot
fire. Tom looked back, hoping to discover the
enemy winged and dropping out of the fight.
Nothing of the kind occurred; but on the contrary
his antagonist was sailing on, apparently
untouched, at least in any vital point.</p>

<p>That meant it must all be tried over again.
The second round in the air duel was about to
open. It was impossible to predict what the
outcome might be, but at any rate Tom felt
renewed courage and confidence.</p>

<p>If he had passed through one siege unscathed
he believed he could show considerable improvement
the next time. Already had he learned
how he might avoid several little errors of judgment,
not much in themselves possibly; but
which tended to interfere with his doing the one
thing necessary&#8211;firing point blank into the muffled
face of the German pilot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>Once more were they rushing headlong
toward each other. Tom was steadier now, and
more alert. He had his plan of campaign
mapped out clearly in his mind. He had moreover
noticed a weak point about the other's
method of attack, of which he intended to take
advantage.</p>

<p>The other three Americans were just as hotly
engaged not far away; but it was a case of
every man for himself. Tom counted on receiving
no assistance. Indeed, while that feeling of
confidence pulsed through his veins he would
have scorned to call for help, or even to allow
it, if he could prevent such a thing.</p>

<p>Again the guns opened fire as the two foes
advanced with savage fury. Such a battle in
the clouds is on a plane that almost beggars
description. Nothing resembling it has ever
been known before in all the annals of history
until the present world war broke out, and the
airplane was perfected as it stands to-day.</p>

<p>This attack was even more tumultuous than
the first had been. The planes tried dodging,
and several tricks were brought to bear on
either side; for it seems that every pilot has
his pet theories as to how best to catch an
opponent napping. Everything is fair, once the
battle royal has started and German wit is
matched against American, or French.</p>

<p>Again did they pass each other for a sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
dip. Each feared to be caught in a condition
that would not permit of defense. They looked
for all the world like a couple of agile boxers
engaged in a contest, in which foot-work counted
almost as much as that of the fists.</p>

<p>Around and around they flew, coming back
to the attack a third, and even a fourth time.
Tom was beginning to grow impatient. Try
as he could, he did not seem able to bring the
other down, though he was almost sure he had
poked his rapid-fire gun straight for the German's
face, and when only a comparatively short
distance away.</p>

<p>"I've got to get him!" he muttered. "Or
else he'll get me!"</p>

<p>He wondered whether there could be anything
in what he had heard one old aviator
say, to the effect that he firmly believed some
of those Germans must be wearing armor or
suits of mail, since he had poured streams of
missiles straight at them, and without the least
appreciable effect.</p>

<p>The German was getting a bit reckless. No
doubt he had anticipated an easy victory over
the other, whom he must have guessed was
something of a beginner at this sort of aerial
combat. Tom's agility in avoiding punishment
annoyed him; likewise the way the bullets
splashed around him had a disconcerting effect
on his mind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>This was the fifth dash, and it seemed as
though the time had come when one or the
other should win the contest. They were growing
more and more desperate now; the fire of
the battle had gone to their heads, and each
must have made up his mind to finish the fight
then and there, judging from the way they
headed straight toward one another. At any
rate Tom had determined that he must win,
and win without delay.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Tom realized suddenly that he had been
struck, for he felt a sudden acute twinge.
He neither knew nor cared how serious the
injury might be, so long as it did not incapacitate
him from serving his machine. And, best
of all, thus far no missile from that popping
mitrailleuse of the German had done serious
damage to the vitals of his plane.</p>

<p>Let the bullets cut holes all they pleased
through the linen of the wings; there would be
no splitting, as happens in the case of cotton or
other fabrics; and such tiny apertures do not
count for much in retarding the upholding
power of a plane.</p>

<p>Another dash, and this time Tom felt absolutely
certain he had made a hit. It seemed to
him he must have fairly riddled the other pilot,
so close was he when he poured all that torrent
of lead aboard his craft.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>They rushed past one another, but Tom took
the earliest possible opportunity to redress, and
look back at his foe. A thrill ran through his
entire being as he discovered that the other
was in trouble. The Fokker was descending in
erratic spirals, evidently out of control. Man
or machine, perhaps both, had come within the
deadly line of fire, and the fight was over.</p>

<p>Turning, Tom watched the enemy plane go
down. He had a queer, choking sensation in
his throat. Every novice probably feels that
when he watches his first rival heading earthward,
with a mile or more to fall before he
strikes. Still, Tom grimly held his feelings in
check. A successful air pilot, especially when
he manages a fighting craft, can not let sentiment
get the better of his combative spirit.
It is a fair test of skill and endurance, and as
a rule the better man wins the game. And war
must always be an exhibition of cruelty in that
human lives are the stake played for.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Tom was secretly glad to discover
that the plane was being fairly well guided
to earth, showing that the German pilot,
though he had lost his fight, could not have
been killed outright, or even mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Tom now found a chance to look around,
and note what was going on. It was just then
that one of the leading American aviators drove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
at his antagonist in a series of zigzag spins
that must have bewildered the German, he
never having run up against such tactics before.</p>

<p>The consequence was the enemy met defeat.
Tom knew what was going to happen as soon
as he saw the chief star of the Lafayette Escadrille
start his favorite attack. And ten seconds
afterwards a second Teuton plane was whirling
around aimlessly and falling. It turned in its
flight so that its white belly showed plainly just
as a fish will in its death throes.</p>

<p>But the pilot was game to the finish, and
managed in some wonderful fashion to swing
his damaged craft around again, so that when
it landed with a crash it fell bottom-down, and
the motor did not come on top of him.</p>

<p>Later on Tom learned that the man was badly
injured, and made a prisoner. Eventually he
pulled through, though it was reported he
would never be fit for flying again, even if he
gained his freedom.</p>

<p>The other two Germans had retreated, deeming
the Americans too strong for them. And
Tom hoped it would be some time before others
could muster up sufficient courage to go aloft,
to pit their machines with those of the members
of the Lafayette Escadrille.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>AFTER THE BATTLE</span></h2>

<p>During all this turmoil the fire-control plane
pilot had kept his machine at work. While
the fighting guard engaged the German, the
observer aboard the larger craft continued to
send his signals to the batteries far in the
rear of the French advanced lines; and through
the successful working of the undertaking a
number of heavy Teuton guns had already been
silenced.</p>

<p>Tom now found time to look down, using
his glasses for the purpose, since the air in
their immediate vicinity was clear of enemy
planes. He could see something of the battle,
though so much smoke lay above the battleground
that it was only when this lifted
temporarily that an occasional fugitive glimpse
could be obtained of the earth.</p>

<p>The French were undoubtedly pushing the
Germans well out of their advance trenches.
They had already gone forward far enough to
redeem a fairly wide stretch of territory that
had been taken from them at the time the
forces of the Crown Prince made their forward
drive, at the cost of more than a hundred
thousand men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>Tom now felt another twinge in his shoulder.
On looking into the matter he discovered, as
he suspected, that he had been wounded. Blood
was showing on his thick fur-lined coat.</p>

<p>Just then a plane approached him. Tom
recognized the mark on the side, and knew
the muffled figure seated in the machine was
the commander of the escadrille. He was
coming to ascertain whether the novice had
drawn out of his first combat entirely unscathed.</p>

<p>He had, in truth, cast many an anxious,
fleeting look toward the pair while Tom was
"doing his bit" for France; for after discovering
that the German was an experienced pilot,
and a man to be feared, the captain would
gladly have flown to the relief of Tom only
that he had his hands full with the Teuton he
had attacked.</p>

<p>He made motions as he approached at
reduced speed. Tom could not hear a sound
save the loud beat of his own motor, but he
knew what the other was asking.</p>

<p>So he touched his left shoulder with his
finger, and held that up to show that it was
reddened. Then the Captain made a quick
motion that was meant for a command. Tom
was to go down. There was no necessity for
his remaining aloft longer, now that another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
had arrived to relieve him from the post of
duty. He ought to call it a day's work, and
have his shoulder attended to.</p>

<p>Regretfully Tom obeyed. His fighting spirit
was aroused, and he would gladly have accepted
a second challenge to combat, had the opportunity
come. He nodded his head to show he
understood, and then started back toward the
French lines.</p>

<p>All this time shrapnel had been bursting
here, there and everywhere underneath them;
but no one paid much attention to the shower.
Indeed, shrapnel does not account for as many
hostile planes as might be imagined; since each
looks like a fly when ten thousand feet high,
and the surrounding space is so vast.</p>

<p>So Tom swung past the advance French
lines, just as they were making another forward
movement. He could glimpse long lines of
poilus streaming over the shell-hole pitted
terrain like ants in army array. Tom would
have been pleased to hover above them for
a while, and watch how those furious fighters
rushed the Boches out of their second line
trenches, as though nothing could stay their
push.</p>

<p>Beyond the French barrage fire was falling
like a curtain. Tom could tell this from the
constant line of explosions that took place. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
Germans in the second trenches would have no
chance of going back through that deadly hailstorm
of shells; they must either die at their
posts, or surrender, he saw.</p>

<p>So fifteen minutes later Tom dropped to the
field, ran his plane up close to the hangar,
and then as a figure dashed wildly toward him,
started to climb wearily from his seat.</p>

<p>Of course it was Jack. He was wild with
delight, and was swinging his cap above his
head with all the animation of a schoolboy.</p>

<p>"Oh! to think that I saw it all, Tom!" was
what he cried, as he seized the hand of his
chum, and squeezed it fiercely, almost crying in
his excitement.</p>

<p>"You did!" exclaimed the other. "How did
that happen, when I had the glasses aloft with
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I borrowed a pair from an obliging
French officer. When he understood that you
were my chum, and that it was your first trial
at combat in the air, he gladly accommodated
me. They are willing to do almost anything
for us Americans. My heart was up in my
throat every time you rushed at that terrible
Boche pilot!"</p>

<p>"But how could you pick me out at that
distance?" demanded Tom incredulously, for it
seemed almost unbelievable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>"I guessed that our captain would have you
hold back when he and the other two started
to meet the rising Germans," said Jack. "You
see, I was wise enough to believe he would want
you to butt in only in case a fourth Boche came
along. And when that happened I knew your
chance had come."</p>

<p>"It was pretty exciting while it lasted,"
remarked Tom grimly.</p>

<p>They were soon on the road to the villa,
going in one of the cars used to take the pilots
when going to and returning from work. There
was a surgeon at hand, and an examination of
Tom's hurt was made. It proved to be a small
matter, though it had bled quite freely.</p>

<p>"You must take a few days' rest, young
M'sieu," the army surgeon told the young
aviator after he had dressed the wound. "It
was a narrow escape, I assure you. Three
inches further down, and I would not like to
have answered for your life. But evidently
France had further need of your excellent services.
I salute you, M'sieu Raymond, you have
this day done your duty well, and won your
spurs."</p>

<p>The air service boys could not remain quietly
at the villa while all that furor was going on.
They wished to be at the hangars, to greet
those who returned, and give the pilots who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
were sallying forth a last word of encouragement.</p>

<p>It was a long day, and full of thrilling
happenings. Other battles in the air occurred
along the extended front, and not all of them
wound up in victories for the Allied forces.
Some distinguished Teuton "aces" were flying
on that occasion who would not be denied their
toll. But the Lafayette Escadrille lost none of
its members, Tom and Jack were glad to learn.</p>

<p>Night finally set its pall over the field where
all day long the hostile armies had fought
and bled. The French were grimly holding
their seized terrain, and hurling the Germans
back again and again. The serried ranks had
pushed forward up to within an hour of sunset;
then, apparently realizing that it was a hopeless
task, the Teuton High Command had given
the order to withdraw.</p>

<p>On the following day the battle was not
resumed. The French had their hands full in
strengthening and fortifying their new positions,
while the Germans must have been so severely
punished and "shot to pieces" that they needed
time to effect the reorganization of their various
battalions and regiments.</p>

<p>So several days passed, and nothing out of
the ordinary happened, at least in connection
with the two chums. Tom's slight wound was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
healing fast, and he was told by the army
surgeon that it would be quite safe for him
to go up again at any time now, a fact that
pleased the young aviator immensely.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make a record for myself," he
told his chum.</p>

<p>"You're the fellow to do it," answered Jack.
"Wish I was in your shoes."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SHOW ON THE FRONT</span></h2>

<p>While the fighting on the Verdun front was
furious at times, with prolonged spasms when
the Germans seemed determined to recover the
territory they had lost to the French, there were
also periods of almost total calm.</p>

<p>During these quiet periods the members of
the American escadrille were sometimes hard
pushed for ways in which to pass the time away,
and amuse themselves. Inaction fretted most
of them, since they were endowed with that
restless spirit which seems to be the inherent
trait of most Americans.</p>

<p>Many were the expedients tried by means
of which some amusement might be extracted
from life. Their daily business was so exciting
that these slumps left the aviators nervous and
unhappy. It was like the sailor who, bowling
along under full pressure of canvas for weeks,
in the old days of the sailing vessel, suddenly
found himself in the "doldrums," and becalmed
for what might be an indefinite period&#8211;it was
apt to wear upon a nervous system that
demanded work.</p>

<p>Of course the pilots were merry while at meals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
and during their loafing periods; but every time
one of their number returned from the front
and reported the inaction as still continuing,
many deep sighs of discontent would arise.</p>

<p>Then a clever thought occurred to some one
of the men. Perhaps it was suggested by a
happy-go-lucky Irish aviator who was connected
with the British air forces, and wore the marks
of distinguished service on his arm and cap.</p>

<p>Sergeant Barney McGee had received a
month's furlough in order to recover from
injuries which he had sustained. Instead of
going back to Ireland to spend his enforced
vacation, as one might naturally expect him
to do, McGee put in the time visiting other
parts of the long front between Ypres and
Verdun.</p>

<p>After all, there was nothing so very singular
about that. Give an old railroad engineer a
week off, and presently you will discover him
spending the time loafing around the roundhouse,
chatting with the other engineers, and
investigating things. His whole life being
wrapped up in his work his idea of a vacation
consists of being free to watch his fellows of
the same craft work.</p>

<p>Sergeant McGee was an exceedingly droll
chap. He spent a couple of weeks with a French
cousin who was also an aviator, and in time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
came to know the jolly members of the Lafayette
Escadrille. He grew to be exceedingly
fond of them all, and was in the mess-room
nearly every night.</p>

<p>His idea was that they should get up a show
to pass these dull evenings away. If the enemy
allowed them sufficient time they could even
give a public performance, and give the proceeds
to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>It took like wildfire with the Americans,
casting about at the time for some way to kill
dull care, and make the hours pass more quickly
until called to action again.</p>

<p>A survey developed the fact that there were
a number in and out of the Lafayette Escadrille
who possessed a talent of some kind or other.
This one had a violin which he loved to play;
and, while not a finished artist, he was able
to make real and lovely music by means of
his clever bow. Another, it turned out, had
a good tenor voice, and knew many of the most
popular songs of the day. A third showed a
talent for mimicking well known people, particularly
Americans of national fame. Several
agreed to black up, and give a humorous little
minstrel skit that they declared would set the
house in a roar.</p>

<p>It was Barney McGee himself who most
astonished the Americans, however. At the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
first rehearsal he appeared before their astonished
eyes dressed to imitate a well known
and popular moving picture star and he carried
out the part in a fashion that caused the wildest
excitement. From that moment the success of
the show was assured.</p>

<p>They made feverish preparations, for no one
could tell just when the period of inaction would
come to an end, and every available member
of the several fraternizing escadrilles be ordered
to rush to the front again, to take his life in
his hands, and risk it hourly for the great
cause.</p>

<p>Tom and Jack both had parts in the entertainment.
Jack made a good "bones" for the
minstrels, and he coaxed his chum to don a
burnt-cork face for that one evening, and show
what he could do as a comedian of parts.</p>

<p>They found a building in Bar-le-Duc that
could be used, and which would hold a
respectable sized audience. Little preparation
was needed save to build a stage and get seating
arrangements. Where chairs were not available
benches had to take their place. Lights were
also provided, and what few accessories they
needed, such as curtains and stage scenery, were
improvised after a fashion.</p>

<p>In the spirit of fun that prevailed "any old
thing went," as Jack expressed it. The makeshifts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
that came to light when the performers
appeared dressed for their various parts were
many and startling. They had borrowed or
begged anything that promised to answer the
purpose from a long-tailed French coat to a
lady's highly colored shawl. Wigs had been
sent for, and Paris had responded with an
assortment that left nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>The members of the two French air
squadrons whose headquarters were near by,
had entered into the affair with great zest. They
blessed the little Irish pilot for his suggestion.
And Sergeant Barney McGee was on the jump
all day long, displaying all the sterling traits
that distinguish able generals and leaders of
men.</p>

<p>The time approached when the entertainment
was to come off. The performers were sure
of a full house, provided no war orders were
issued that would interfere with the arrangements.</p>

<p>"Since Fritz has kept quiet for so many dreary
days now," one pilot was heard to say on the
morning of the entertainment, "let us hope we'll
have just one more peaceful evening to reap
the reward of all this training. It would break
the heart of Sergeant Barney if the order came
for every one to buckle down to hard work
just when his big show is about to come off."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>The weather man proved friendly, for he gave
them a splendid day, with the promise of a
moonlight night. Besides, the cold had pretty
well vanished, and it was really becoming more
seasonable, with the sun warming the earth,
and the mud drying up to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>When the show opened that night it was to
a house jammed to the doors. Even the
windows were utilized for seating room; and
crowds stood without, unable to gain admittance.</p>

<p>"Some crowd, eh?" remarked Jack, as he
watched the airmen, soldiers and others pouring
in.</p>

<p>"I should say so!" cried Tom. "I hope we
make good."</p>

<p>It was certainly a unique performance, considering
the fact that it was given in a camp
close to the battle lines; and that at any hour
every one of those who were dressed so
fancifully and conducted themselves as actors
born to the stage, might be called on to mount
to the clouds, and perform their dangerous
work of fighting for France, perhaps even giving
up their lives.</p>

<p>Loud applause greeted every individual act.
The violin music drew tears from eyes unused
to weeping, because the strains of "Way Down
Upon the Suwannee River," "Home, Sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
Home," and other loved airs tenderly and
beautifully played, as they were, carried the
Americans back again to those near and dear,
those whom they might never again see on this
earth.</p>

<p>The songs were rapturously applauded, and
the singers forced to give encore after encore.
One youth who played the part of a little maid
from school, and sang in a sweet soprano voice,
caused the greatest enthusiasm of the evening;
but then everything seemed to make a decided
hit.</p>

<p>Tom and Jack, as members of the minstrel
troupe, did their parts well, though neither
professed to be a star of the first magnitude.
They certainly enjoyed seeing and hearing the
others go through with their appointed tasks.
As for Sergeant Barney McGee, he drew the
house down every time he appeared on the
stage in his quaint dress, and with the famous
walk that is the trade-mark of the character
whom he represented.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the entire show was soon carried
out. Indeed, the rest was to be more or less
a repetition of preceding acts, though the
pleased audience seemed eager to sit for another
hour, and applaud each turn vigorously and
uproariously.</p>

<p>However, it was not fated that the evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
should pass entirely without some interruption.
Afterwards the actors, and those who had
enjoyed the performance from in front, agreed
that they had been exceedingly lucky as it was,
and that "half a loaf was much better than
no bread at all."</p>

<p>Those whose turns were finished remained,
of course, as part of the audience. Some of
the black-faced artists lingered in the so-called
"wings" to watch what was going on, desirous
of getting all the fun possible out of the
evening.</p>

<p>It was not a case of "eat, drink, and be merry,
for to-morrow we die;" but "have all the happy
times you can, fellows, while the going is good,
for to-morrow we fight."</p>

<p>Sergeant Barney McGee was on again, and
the audience was convulsed with laughter over
his ludicrous antics. He appeared to be a born
actor and mimic; and had they not known
otherwise Tom and Jack could have declared
that the comedian who was under contract with
an American film company, and doubtless in
California making pictures at that moment, had
been suddenly transported to the French fighting
front to entertain the soldiers.</p>

<p>Suddenly the laughter came to a stop. The
building in which the show was being held shook
as though a violent thunderclap had rocked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
earth. This loud detonation that broke upon
their hearing, however, was only too familiar
to all those army aviators. They understood
its dread meaning.</p>

<p>The enemy had taken this opportunity to
send over a squadron of raiding Fokkers to
bomb the hangars of the French and American
fliers at Bar-le-Duc!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>CLOWNS ON THE WING</span></h2>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>What followed that first heavy detonation
was very much like a riot. The audience became
frantic under the belief that it meant an attack
on the town, and that the missiles would
presently drop upon the roofs, working destruction
to everything around.</p>

<p>It was the actors, however, who were the
most exercised. One and all they understood
what it meant to them. Their planes were in
danger of being demolished! In some way the
Teutons must have learned about the entertainment,
and realized that almost every Allied
pilot would want to attend it. They rightly
guessed that for once the guard about the
aviation field and numerous hangars where the
dozens upon dozens of planes of every
description were housed when not in use, would
be unusually light. They had also taken
advantage of the bright moonlight to make a
bold sally over the French lines and reach this
distant point undiscovered.</p>

<p>Boom! boom! boom!</p>

<p>Other crashing sounds announced that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
enemy machines were busily at work. Each
pilot pictured the entire camp under bombardment,
with the utmost disaster overtaking the
airplanes upon which General Petain was
depending so much to serve as the "eyes" of
his brave army.</p>

<p>There was a general and maddened rush.
Every one wanted to get to the camp in the
briefest possible space of time. There was no
chance for the actors to change their clothes.
They were glad enough of an opportunity to
snatch up a heavy fur-lined coat, either their
own or some other person's. With this to
hide their ludicrous attire, and also give some
needed warmth once they went aloft, they
hastened to find a waiting car, which, when
loaded to its capacity, would be sent like mad
along the road to the aviation field.</p>

<p>It was one of the most amazing sights
imaginable, to see those pilots, many of whom
were world famous, thus garbed. It looked as
though some asylum of freaks had opened its
doors and allowed the inmates to escape to the
highways and byways.</p>

<p>Only one thought possessed them all, which
was to get to the hangars in the shortest possible
time. When they arrived each anticipated
seeking his particular plane. If that chanced to
be out of commission, then commandeering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
any other, it mattered little whose, so long as
they were able to go up, and give battle to
the audacious Teuton pilots who had raided
their camp at Bar-le-Duc.</p>

<p>"We've got to save our machines!" cried
Tom. "Come on!"</p>

<p>"Right you are!" responded Jack.</p>

<p>Tom and Jack were with the rest who found
some way to crowd aboard one of the waiting
cars that were seized upon to carry the pilots
to the field. As they went booming furiously
along the road they could still hear those
frightful explosions ahead, each one accompanied
by a flash as of lightning. The reports
were almost deafening.</p>

<p>Eager eyes were turned aloft. The moon
shone, but it was difficult to make out so small
an object as an airplane at a height of a mile
or more without the use of searchlights, and
even these were not very efficient on such a
night.</p>

<p>Still, some of the pilots believed they could
see several enemy planes swooping over at a
lower level, possibly, they thought, on the
lookout for the procession of cars bearing the
aroused Allied aviators to the hangars.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>A bomb fell not fifty feet away from the car
in which the two chums were seated. One of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
their companions received a trifling wound from
the effect of the explosion of the TNT contents
of the bomb, said to be the most powerful
known for such uses, and handled by the
engineers of all the armies, under different
names.</p>

<p>If the design of the Boche who swooped down
for the purpose of waylaying the cars carrying
the French and American airmen was to rob
the Allies of the services of a dozen eminent
pilots all at once, it failed in execution.</p>

<p>At last the aviators arrived on the scene.
It was lively enough, with bombs still bursting
here and there. Already considerable damage
had been done to some of the hangars.</p>

<p>The Allied pilots were "mad all the way
through" at having been caught napping by
the foe. They paid no attention to the danger
that still hung over their heads, with the
enemy's supply of explosives as yet unexhausted.
While the dreadful detonations continued,
sometimes exceedingly close by, the various
pilots seized upon such mechanicians as they
could.</p>

<p>One by one the planes rolled along the field
and began to climb upward by way of the
usual spiral staircase route, to give battle to
the enemy, regardless of any superiority in
numbers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>Jack was dismayed to discover that his plane
was badly wrecked by one of the explosions.
Indeed, it was afterwards found that he had
to have a new machine, since the repairs
necessary to put the old one into service again
were too complicated to be done at the front.</p>

<p>Tom was more fortunate. His hangar had
also suffered to some extent, but so far as
could be seen in a hasty examination his plane
was not injured in the least.</p>

<p>He too went up, burnt-corked face and all.
There were clowns abroad that night who could
give Tom many points in the game, so far as
comical looks went, and still easily win the
stakes. But all else was forgotten under the
spur of the moment, save that each man was
eager to get in touch with the Boche pilots
who had almost spoiled their one great evening.</p>

<p>But no longer were those crashing detonations
coming. This told the story only too well.
The Germans had either exhausted their supply
of bombs, or else they deemed discretion the
better part of valor. They had evidently taken
their departure before the first Allied pilot got
up to the elevation they had been using in
their bombardment.</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen of them, though had
the Allied pilots been able to use their ears,
which was impossible when their own motors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
were making such loud noises, they might have
heard, in the distance and to the east, the telltale
music of Teuton propellers beating the air in
a rush for home ports.</p>

<p>A pursuit was organized, and several planes
followed the retreating invaders over the entire
distance to the front; but it was of no avail.
The enemy planes had had too good a start, and
were being pushed for all they were worth to
get beyond the danger zone.</p>

<p>There had been several accidents at the
Bar-le-Duc field, but none of them fatal. This
was not at all surprising, considering the haste
shown by the pilots to mount and engage the
foemen.</p>

<p>Too, several of the planes besides Jack's had
been damaged, a circumstance which brought
about disaster before the aviator was able to
leave the ground.</p>

<p>As the fliers came back one after another,
filled with indignation and disappointed hopes,
Jack stalked about, with his black face, yet
laughed to see what comical pictures most of
his fellow aviators made.</p>

<p>By degrees most of them began to realize
that the joke was on them, and joined in greeting
with noisy shouts each fresh arrival from above.
The damage had not been so very serious after
all, since most of the Teuton bombs had either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
failed to explode when aimed true, or else only
dug enormous craters in the ground where
it did not matter, sometimes even a quarter
of a mile away from the hangars. Jack's machine,
it was found, was the only one badly
damaged.</p>

<p>From that time there was one subject on
which American and French pilots were agreed.
They must certainly repay their enemy rivals
for this visitation. The honors could not
continue to be all on one side.</p>

<p>So from that hour every Allied pilot who
went far back of the German lines used his
glasses diligently, in the endeavor to locate the
secret aviation field of the Boche. This would
naturally be camouflaged in the customary
fashion, at which the Teutons had become
almost as proficient as the French; but trust
an airman to spy out the lodging place of his
kind.</p>

<p>Step by step they learned which direction the
enemy planes took in coming to the front, and
retiring when through for the day. Thus in
good time the hiding place was found. Great
was the delight of the whole Lafayette Escadrille
when this confidential news was passed about.
And, later on, a party of Allied aviators paid
a night visit to the German camp, and dropped
several tons of high explosives from bombing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
planes, that were heavily guarded by the fighting
Nieuports.</p>

<p>They had reason to believe from what they
themselves saw, as well as through a secret
report received from a French spy, that their
aim had been remarkably fine; and that many
times the amount of damage the Germans had
done at Bar-le-Duc had been carried out on
the reprisal sally.</p>

<p>After that it seemed as though the slate had
been wiped clean. Their honor had been fully
purged of the stain that had rested on it ever
since that dreadful night when they were caught
off their guard.</p>

<p>It turned out that the enemy had meant to
start an action on the following day, and it
had been hoped that the squadron of airmen
might so cripple the French service that the advantage
would be all on the side of the assailants.</p>

<p>Something happened, however, to balk the
plans of the Crown Prince. Perhaps he had a
reprimand from his august father and emperor
for so recklessly sacrificing such vast numbers of
his men in a fruitless assault against the stonewall
defensive of the French army. It may
also have been something else that called the
attack off, but at any rate it failed of accomplishment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>The stagnation along the front continued;
but all this while General Petain was making
quiet though effective preparations, in order
some day to strike a staggering blow, such as
the French had before given, which would take
the enemy by surprise, and push him still
further back.</p>

<p>Jack was fretting because thus far he had
seen so little of real action. Since his Nieuport
had been sent away, and another had as yet
failed to arrive for his use, he often bewailed
his ill-luck. He even assured his chum the
"green mould would be growing all over his
person if something didn't soon come to pass
to break the terrible monotony."</p>

<p>But every lane, however long, must have its
turning; and Jack's hour struck at last.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>MORE WORK IN PROSPECT</span></h2>

<p>"Tom, sit down here on this bench, won't
you? I want to have a little talk with you
about some things that have bothered me a
whole lot lately," said Jack, some days after
the exciting experiences narrated in the two
preceding chapters.</p>

<p>"I can give a pretty good guess what they
are, Jack, since I see you staring hard at the
slip of paper found attached to the toy balloon
which drifted over our lines from somewhere
back of the German front."</p>

<p>"Yes; I own up I do sit and look at that
paper, Tom. If it could only talk I'd know
who penned that warning, and my curiosity'd
be satisfied for one thing. But try as hard as
I may, I can't be certain whether it was Mrs.
Neumann, or somebody else. But I wanted
to speak to you about Bessie just now."</p>

<p>"What about her, Jack?" asked Tom,
knowing how much his chum was concerned
over the unknown fate of the pretty young
girl they had met on the Atlantic liner, and
who was apparently anything but happy in the
charge of her legally appointed guardian, Carl
Potzfeldt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>"There are several things she told me, half
unwillingly, I admit, that I guess I haven't said
anything about to you, Tom."</p>

<p>"Then she confided her secrets to you, eh?"
half chuckled Tom; though he saw his chum
was in anything but a humorous frame of mind.
"I remember you told me she felt very bitter
toward all Germans because she had lost her
mother when the <i>Lusitania</i> went down."</p>

<p>"Yes. But this had to do with her guardian,"
Jack continued.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see! Mr. Potzfeldt, Jack? You haven't
felt favorably disposed toward that gentleman
at any time since first meeting him."</p>

<p>"Neither have you, Tom, to tell the truth!"
declared the other quickly. "In fact, as I
remember it, both of us were pretty much
inclined to believe he was a paid spy of the
German Government, working on some line
of dark business over in America. Well, he
had to clear out in a hurry, Bessie told
me."</p>

<p>"Did the authorities get track of his scheming
work, and was he in danger of being arrested
for plotting against Uncle Sam's interests as
a neutral?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>"It may have been that; but Bessie wasn't
sure about it. In fact, she seemed inclined to
believe her guardian had some secret, which was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
in danger of being exposed. An old friend of
her mother's was interesting himself in the
matter. Given time, he might have made it
uncomfortable for Carl Potzfeldt; and so the
gentleman cleared out between two days."</p>

<p>"Taking Bessie with him!"</p>

<p>"Yes. They made as if to go to Chicago,
but instead hurried to New York. When he
came aboard at the last call he kept to his
cabin for a time, until we were well away from
land. There has been considerable of mystery
about his actions. Bessie is afraid of him, too.
She even hinted that she believed he might
have obtained control of her fortune and
herself through fraud, and that this was in
danger of being found out at the time he cut
stick and ran."</p>

<p>"All this is interesting, Jack; but just when
and how we're ever going to learn the truth
about it I'm unable even to guess. It would
be like hunting for a needle in a haystack to
try to find Potzfeldt. He and his pretty little
ward may be hundreds of miles away from
here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right, Tom," mused the
other sadly, as he stared afar off toward the
north. "I'd be glad of a chance to do something
for that poor girl. She is to be greatly pitied,
if she's wholly in the power of a man who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
wouldn't hesitate to do <i>anything</i>, if he saw a
chance for gain ahead."</p>

<p>"Well, all you can do, Jack, is to live on and
hope a lucky chance will bob up for you. But
there's our captain beckoning to me. Perhaps
another battle is on the carpet for to-morrow,
and I'll be given a look-in again."</p>

<p>"Oh, if the lightning would only strike me
too!" sighed Jack, enviously. "Please beg him
to figure out something I can do, Tom. If
it's only occupying a place aboard an observation
plane or taking photographs of the Germans
regrouping far back of the lines, I'd gladly
welcome it. Anything but sitting here, when
all the other pilots are at work."</p>

<p>Tom hurried to join the commander of the
Lafayette Escadrille. He had taken a great
fancy to the gallant man, and believed this
feeling was in a measure returned. Jack
continued to sit and mope. He really felt
slighted to be left out when so much thrilling
work was being done.</p>

<p>He had put away the well-thumbed scrap
of paper with its mysterious lines of warning,
for the time being Bessie and all her troubles
passing from his mind. Jack was now full of
his own affairs. He found himself growing a
bit discontented because thus far he had been
allowed to do so little for the cause, when his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
heart was full to overflowing with a desire to
assist.</p>

<p>There were aviators going and coming all
the time, and surely many of them did not
excel him appreciably in talents. Why did not
those in charge find something for an ambitious
pilot to do? He was striving daily to master
the weak spots in his education; and had not
the captain himself assured him he was doing
bravely? He turned to cast an occasional look
toward the spot where Tom and the commander
of the air squadron still talked earnestly. Yes,
something was certainly "on tap," as Jack expressed
it, for he saw the other carefully examining
a bit of paper his companion had evidently
placed in his hand.</p>

<p>Jack began to be interested. Perhaps after
all it might turn out to be something quite
different from what Tom had anticipated. Had
the captain simply wished to notify the other to
be ready to answer a call on the following morning,
surely he need not have taken all this
time; nor would he have given Tom that paper,
undoubtedly carrying explicit instructions.</p>

<p>How the minutes dragged! Jack thought
it an eternity before he saw Tom and the
captain separate. He was glad to notice that
his chum once more headed in the direction of
the spot where they had been seated on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
bench back of the long row of frame buildings
used for permanent hangars at the Bar-le-Duc
aviation field.</p>

<p>Yes, Tom had evidently been told something
that pleased him very much. His smile admitted
the fact, and Jack knew by now just how to
read the face of his comrade so as to get a
good idea of what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p>"Looks like good news, Tom," he cried out,
for motors were rattling and throbbing,
mechanicians and helpers, as well as pilots,
calling to one another, and all manner of sounds
combining to make a great racket.</p>

<p>Tom shrugged his shoulders in a non-committal
way, which might mean a whole lot, and
again might express a small fraction of
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been given a job, if that's what
you mean," he admitted, as he dropped down
once more on the bench alongside Jack, and
threw one leg over the other.</p>

<p>"More fighting to-morrow, possibly?" queried
Jack, anxiously. But he found his curiosity
further whetted when Tom shook his head in
the negative.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily this time, it seems," he went
on to say; "though of course you never can
tell what you'll strike when once you pass fifty
miles, more or less, behind the enemy front."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>Jack pursed his lips up as if about to whistle,
but he made no sound. It was only a visible
indication of surprise on his part&#8211;surprise, and
an eager desire to know just what his chum
was so slow in telling him.</p>

<p>"Another bombing raid, then, is it?"</p>

<p>"Never a bomb going along this time," came
the puzzling answer. "Nor is there going to
be a big bunch of planes starting out. I'm to
be the only pilot in the game this time,
Jack."</p>

<p>"You're knocking me silly with that, Tom,"
protested the other young aviator. "I can see
the twinkle in your eyes, as if you were holding
something back, so as to tantalize me. Are
you free to tell me what this business of
yours it is the captain has just handed over
to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, surely, Jack. He told me I could take
<i>one</i> fellow into my confidence, and no more.
So I mean to tell you all about it."</p>

<p>Tom turned and cast a careful look around.
They were not very close to any of the hangars,
it happened; and none of the many helpers
and attendants could possibly overhear what
was said, with all that clatter constantly going
on.</p>

<p>"I guess it's perfectly safe for me to talk
here, Jack, and not give the thing away. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
know it does seem that the German spies are
able to penetrate nearly everywhere, and pick
up all sorts of valuable information, to send
across the line in any one of a dozen different
ways."</p>

<p>"Yes. But go on, Tom."</p>

<p>"It seems there is need of some one to go
to-night to a particular place far back of the
German lines&#8211;in fact, close to the fortified city
of Metz itself. In a certain place, inside a hollow
post, will be found a paper marked in cipher,
and containing much valuable information which
has been collected by one of the ablest of the
French spies. He is really a native of Alsace-Lorraine,
and well thought of by the Germans.
As it is utterly out of the question for him
to report in person, he has adopted this way
of getting his news to General Petain. And
as there is a scarcity of pilots capable of doing
this work our captain has selected me to
undertake it for the cause."</p>

<p>"But Tom, I should have thought he would
have picked out some one more familiar with
the ground back there. How can you find
your way to that particular place, if you've
never been there before?"</p>

<p>"I've been given directions that are bound
to take me right," Tom assured his worried
chum. "There was a man they used for this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
purpose, and several times he's brought back
the papers; but on his last trip he had the
misfortune to run into a bunch of cruising
Fokkers, and they brought him down. He fell
fortunately inside the French lines, so his papers
were saved; but Francois will never handle the
controls of a plane again. He was killed."</p>

<p>"Then there is danger in the game!"</p>

<p>"Certainly there is. But in these times who
could dream of passing so far back of the
German front without expecting to be in
constant peril? The papers will be put in a
little box previously prepared. Should disaster
overtake us, it will be flung overboard, and
before it reaches the ground everything will
have been consumed by the fire that follows."</p>

<p>Jack's eyes began to glitter.</p>

<p>"Just so, Tom! But I notice that you used
the plural pronoun when you spoke. Then you
do not go on this mission alone?"</p>

<p>"No, that's right. I have been given permission
to pick out my one companion, for there
will be two of us aboard the plane to-night."</p>

<p>Jack tried to keep calm, but it was indeed
difficult, and his voice faltered more or less
as he hurriedly went on to say:</p>

<p>"Have you already made your selection?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the other assured him in his tantalizing
way. "I wanted to know whether the captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
approved of my choice; which I am glad to
say turned out to be the case."</p>

<p>Jack gulped something down, and then blurted
out:</p>

<p>"Did you mention my name at all, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Yours was the only one I had in mind; and
Jack, rest easy, you're going along with me
to-night to glimpse the lights of Metz!"</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>OFF ON A DARING MISSION</span></h2>

<p>The two air service boys fell to talking
earnestly concerning what they should take
with them, and how to study a map which
their captain had promised to put in Tom's
hands immediately.</p>

<p>This was not of the ordinary kind, but so
definitely marked for just such an emergency
that even a novice could probably find his way
to Metz, granting that he possessed the necessary
qualifications of an air pilot.</p>

<p>Presently a messenger came with a package
for Tom. This proved to be the chart from
the commander of the air squadron. Tom was
to make as good a copy as was in his power,
for the original was too valuable to risk losing.</p>

<p>Jack understood that there were several reasons
for having Tom do this. In the first place
his work on the chart would familiarize the
young aviator with its every detail, and fix
things firmly in his mind. Then again, if they
were lost, and never returned, the priceless
chart for night voyaging over the enemy's lines
would be at least safe.</p>

<p>Daring men had gone forth on similar desperate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
errands before then, and had never been
heard from again. It is the fortune of war.
Those who indulge in enterprises that border
on the sensational must always expect to sup
with deadly peril.</p>

<p>When the evening meal was announced the
two chums were already deep in the work. Of
course not a whisper of their intended mission
was breathed at the table. No one dreamed
of their contemplated trip. The customary
chatter and good-natured badinage flowed
during the whole supper-time. While some
of the American aviators had received wounds
in recent engagements there had been no chair
vacant for some little time now; and hence no
gloom rested on the escadrille. From the table
the boys again went to their room.</p>

<p>"How far is Metz from Verdun?" asked Jack,
as they labored to complete their preparations
for departure.</p>

<p>"Not over forty miles, I should say, as the
crow flies, Jack. I've never been over the route,
but it can be measured on this copy of the map."</p>

<p>"And that's the direct line we expect to cover,
of course?"</p>

<p>"We'll head due east."</p>

<p>"And as it'll be densely dark when we start
I guess we needn't mount to ten thousand feet
to pass over the enemy lines, eh, Tom?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>"There'll really be little need," came the reply,
showing that the pilot had already figured all
this out. "At the same time we ought to keep
far enough out of range to avoid being struck
by stray shrapnel."</p>

<p>"Will they bombard us, do you think?"
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's to be expected," said Tom
indifferently. "You see the men who man the
anti-aircraft guns are constantly on the alert.
They're bound to hear the whirr of our propeller
as we pass over, no matter how high we soar.
The searchlight will spot us out, and then
they'll do their best to make things uncomfortable
for the pair of us. But the chances
are ten thousand to one against our being
hit."</p>

<p>"You said our course would be due east,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I'll change that assertion a bit, Jack; we
start east after we're well across the front, and
away from the dazzling searchlight business.
In the beginning we'll point the nose of our
big machine toward the north."</p>

<p>"So as to deceive the watchers, of course,"
remarked Jack.</p>

<p>"That's what the game is."</p>

<p>Jack's eyes sparkled. He was always proud
of his chum's clever reasoning powers, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
believed Tom could hold his own with any one
with regard to mapping out a promising plan.</p>

<p>Their preparations completed, the two air
service boys lay down to secure a little rest.
As they were not to start until some time after
midnight, Tom believed they should secure
a few hours of sleep. The moon was a late
one, and would not rise, even with a midnight
start, until they were well back of the enemy
lines.</p>

<p>An alarm-clock aroused them at the appointed
time. Tom immediately shoved the noisy thing
under his blankets before it could wake up the
entire house, and set people wondering what
was happening that any one should want to
be aroused at such an unseemly hour.</p>

<p>It was terribly black outside. Jack pressed
his nose against the window and took a look,
even while hurriedly finishing his dressing.
Tom had taken the precaution to put a fresh
battery in his little hand electric torch, which
he believed would prove to be worth its weight
in gold.</p>

<p>Arriving at their destination, the boys quickly
found their two-seater aircraft awaiting their
coming. Quite a crowd stood around, and made
guesses concerning the possible reason for the
captain's order that this plane should be made
ready for a journey, with enough supplies of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
gasolene and oil aboard to cover any ordinary
emergency.</p>

<p>Tom took no chances. He believed the
attendants had faithfully carried out all directions,
but to make doubly sure he looked over
things himself. It was his life and Jack's that
were at stake, and not those of the attendants;
so he persisted in testing this and that thing
until he felt certain everything was as it should
be.</p>

<p>"Is it time we started, Tom?" asked his
companion, when this procedure had resulted
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>"We'll wait just ten minutes more," he was
told. "I've figured everything down to a
fraction, and expect to proceed by clock-work.
We want to be well over the line before the
moon peeps up. After that we can loaf a bit,
and let the old lady get a little way above
the horizon. That's so we may have the benefit
of her light when we want to land."</p>

<p>The minutes passed slowly. Meanwhile the
crowd increased, every man who chanced to
be abroad at that hour of the night gathering
to see the two Americans start on their
mysterious errand. All sorts of guesses were
indulged in, many of them of the wildest
character. Jack hearing some of this talk, which
he half understood, was convulsed in silent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
laughter over the remarkable ideas that seemed
to possess the minds of those French mechanicians
and hostlers.</p>

<p>Finally Tom stood up.</p>

<p>"It's time!" he said simply, and Jack understood
without any further explanation. He at
once proceeded to climb into his seat and
complete his simple preparations for the work
in hand, being already fully dressed in his
fur-lined garments, and with his warm hood
and goggles in place.</p>

<p>A minute afterwards Tom called out the word
that started the propellers whirling. The motor
took up the refrain, and hummed merrily, as
though glad to be busy again. Then they were
pushed along for a start, gathering momentum
so quickly that the mechanicians dropped back
to watch the dark object vanish almost wholly
from their sight along the level field.</p>

<p>Both boys noticed the great difference
between this two-seater and their own active
little Nieuports. How clumsy this machine was,
and how slow to answer to the call of the pilot!
Yet it would be far better for their purpose
than two of the small aircraft, since it allowed
them to be together.</p>

<p>The few lights of the aviation field near
Bar-le-Duc had faded almost entirely out of
sight by the time Tom turned to the north
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
and headed for Verdun. True, he might have
pointed the nose of the airplane directly east,
and saved considerable distance, but there were
good reasons for not doing this.</p>

<p>To cross the German lines further south
would surely convince the Teutons that the
aviators were heading for the vicinity of Metz,
which was just what Tom did not wish to have
happen. Then again, his chart covered only
the direct line between Verdun and the fortified
city of Lorraine that forty-odd years back had
been French territory, before the Germans
seized it as spoils after the war that made
France a republic for the third time.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MOONLIGHT FLIGHT</span></h2>

<p>The time for talking had passed. With the
motor working noisily, and the twin propellers
churning the air, they could hardly have heard
the discharge of one of the 'Big Berthas', as
the Allies were wont to call the monster Krupp
guns, and so called them because a woman
whose maiden name had been Bertha Krupp,
owned a big interest in the works where they
were manufactured.</p>

<p>All was dark around and below them. Above
the stars shone, and gave a small amount of
cold, cheery light. Tom had made a study of
the heavens, and was able to steer by means of
the stars. The aviator is often as much dependent
on compass and heavenly bodies to
shape his course as the sailor hundreds of miles
away from land.</p>

<p>Tom was in no especial hurry. He had
carefully thought out his plans, and meant to
pass over Verdun at just a certain time. Then
would come the two lines of hostile trenches,
and the ordeal of searchlights and shrapnel.
Once that was done with, they had really little
further to fear.</p>

<p>The minutes slipped away. Under ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
conditions they were accustomed to making
that thirty miles in just about half that number
of minutes, thanks to the ability of the speedy
Nieuports to cover distance. It would be twice
that now before they would find themselves at
the front.</p>

<p>Already they could see various signs to tell
them they were drawing near. Rockets used
as signals of various kinds ascended at intervals,
and burst. Others of the star variety, and which
discharged glowing white electric balls that
lighted the earth below, could also be seen. One
side or the other apparently had some reason
for desiring to scrutinize a special sector of
terrain in No-Man's-Land, the disputed region
lying between the hostile trenches.</p>

<p>Jack used his eyes to advantage. These
things had not yet grown stale with him, for he
still found himself filled with awe and wonder
when gazing down from a lofty height at the
world shrouded in darkness below.</p>

<p>There within a comparatively short distance,
that might not be over twenty miles, a round
million of soldiers were gathered, armed with
numberless engines of destruction of the most
ponderous nature imaginable. It was enough
to give any one a genuine thrill, and Jack felt
such a sensation creeping over him.</p>

<p>The crucial time had now come. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
passing over the line of the French trenches.
Jack knew this from various signs, and also
that in another minute they might expect to
be spotted by some of the enemy searchlights.
These would be unmasked, and trained on the
heavens in the effort to locate the cause of
that well known clattering noise above.</p>

<p>This speedily came about. First one long
shaft of dazzling light rushed back and forth;
then others joined in the hunt, until presently
they focussed on the progressing two-seater
pushing north.</p>

<p>Then began the bombardment. Numerous
anti-aircraft guns were poking their noses upward
in anticipation of just such a call. Their
crews commenced to shower the shrapnel
around and below the bird of passage, whose
mission, whatever it might prove to be, could
mean only evil to the Teuton cause.</p>

<p>All this racket was lost upon the two so far
above the earth. They heard nothing of the
bleat of the firing guns. Even the bursting of
shrapnel went unheeded, save at a time when a
shell exploded close by, and was faintly heard.</p>

<p>Tom was wisely taking but little chance. He
maintained an altitude that prevented most of
the shrapnel from coming anywhere near the
plane.</p>

<p>They crossed the enemy front, and sped on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
The bombardment diminished in fury as they
left the first and second line trenches behind
them. It was continued to some extent from
an elevation further back, but as Tom knew of
this formation, and had crept up still higher,
no accident happened to them.</p>

<p>At last the air service boys were fully
launched on their night voyage through the
upper currents. Tom waited until he considered
that it was really safe to change their course.
He did not want to betray his movements in
case some daring Boche pilot started up in a
swift Fokker machine to pursue them.</p>

<p>Once he shut off the engines and volplaned
down a thousand feet or more. This was done
because it was intensely cold up where they
were; and the reasons that had kept them at
such a high altitude existed no longer. Then
again Tom wished to listen to discover if there
was another aircraft near them; and this could
be done only when his motor was silent.</p>

<p>"No pursuit, Jack!" he managed to call to
his chum before they once more straightened
out, and again allowed the motor to send forth
its loud hum.</p>

<p>Jack had no chance to make any sort of reply.
It did not matter, for he, too, had eagerly
listened, and had failed to catch any telltale
sound.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>Immediately Tom shaped a new course. No
longer were they heading toward the north by
east, but directly east. There some forty miles,
more or less, away, lay the city of Metz, the
object of their mission.</p>

<p>After moving along in this fashion for a short
time Tom drove his machine more slowly. He
was watching for the rising of the old moon
ahead, where the horizon was already lighted
with her near approach.</p>

<p>How strange she looked peering above the
edge of the world as though curious to see all
that was going on in this troubled hemisphere.
Jack thought he had never witnessed a more
peculiar spectacle. But at least this fragment of
a moon would be likely to afford them the
necessary illumination required when they
attempted to land in a field that neither of
them had ever seen before, and only knew
through information imparted by means of their
chart, and its accompanying notes.</p>

<p>Some other pilot had doubtless been over this
same route on previous occasions; yes, and even
landed in that identical field. He had made the
chart; and the accompanying memoranda consisted
of his personal experiences.</p>

<p>Already the moon had dispelled some of the
cheerless gloom round about them. It was
still cold up in that upper strata of rarefied air;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
but their fur-lined garments kept them from
suffering. Besides this, they were young and vigorous,
and their blood was warm, and they
were excited with their mission and able to ignore
any physical discomfort that might come
to them.</p>

<p>Jack continued to stare ahead as time passed.
He was looking for some sign of the city
towards which they were flying. Tom, on his
part, often took note of his compass, then
flashed a glance up at the stars, and finally
sought to discover some landmark far down
below that was marked upon the chart.</p>

<p>He had the utmost confidence in his own
judgment, and believed he would bring up at
the identical place which was their goal.</p>

<p>Tom now volplaned again, wishing to draw
nearer to the earth. It was while thus dropping,
with engine muffled, that his ears caught a
sound calculated to give him an uneasy feeling.</p>

<p>This was undoubtedly the whirr of a propeller
beating the air in furious fashion. It also came
from behind. Jack, too, had caught the sound,
and was thrilled with sudden apprehension of
impending trouble.</p>

<p>They were undoubtedly being pursued, and
by a much faster plane than their own. This
would mean that presently they would be overtaken
and fired upon. It was not in the nature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
of Tom Raymond to allow such a thing to
occur and be kept from doing his share of the
fighting.</p>

<p>When Tom swung around to face the rear,
and actually started to run toward the oncoming
foe, Jack knew what was expected of him. He
must man the gun, and prove how well he had
learned his lesson when at school at Pau and at
Casso.</p>

<p>No longer could they expect to be guided by
sounds. Their own motor thundered so loudly
that every other sound was deadened. They
must depend on eyesight alone to tell them
when they were nearing the oncoming Fokker
craft. Perhaps the first indication they would
have of its presence would be the flash of its
quick-firing gun, spattering bullets around them
like hail.</p>

<p>So Jack strained his vision to the limit. He
was eager to discover the enemy before they
themselves were seen. Much might depend on
who fired first, in a duel of this kind.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gun began to bark after its own
peculiar way. Jack believed he had glimpsed
something moving, and was sending forth a
storm of lead in the hope of a lucky hit that
would crumple the other machine up and put
an end to that peril.</p>

<p>Tom held the course. He knew that every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
second was carrying the rival airplanes nearer
together&#8211;knew that possibly they were so
headed that if they continued to rush forward
they might smash in a frightful collision that
would send both down thousands of feet to the
earth.</p>

<p>It was a time for careful calculations and
prompt action. Tom gripped the controls and
was ready either to swerve or to dip as occasion
demanded. Meanwhile, Jack was doing his best
to riddle the advancing Boche machine and its
pilot.</p>

<p>There was no longer any difficulty in seeing
just where the Fokker was, for a constant flashing
as her gun rattled betrayed its position
exactly. The flying lead was now whistling all
about the two air service boys but they did not
know how close they sailed to death.</p>

<p>Then Tom swung smartly to the right. He
dared not keep on longer in his course lest he
collide with the German craft. Just about the
same instant he realized that the Fokker was
diving. There was something queer about that
manoeuvre. Tom had never known a French
or an American nor yet a British airman to
adopt such a clumsy way of plunging so as to
avoid punishment.</p>

<p>Circling around he started back on a little
lower level, looking for the enemy. In making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
his latest volplane Tom had listened intently,
hoping to ascertain whether the motor of the
enemy craft still throbbed somewhere close by;
but he heard not a sound to tell the story.</p>

<p>Just then, suspicious of the truth, he glanced
down, and was just in time to see a little flash
of flame arise from the distant surface of the
earth. Then the awful truth broke upon both
boys. They realized that the German pilot had
lost control of his machine, which had turned
over and over in its drop, finally crashing to
the ground, and being instantly enveloped in
flames!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>LANDING CLOSE TO METZ</span></h2>

<p>Tom had his hands full in trying to get back
to his course again. Naturally, in the excitement
attending the duel in midair he could not
pay attention to where he was going. It was
easy enough to shape his line of flight by the
aid of the stars and his compass, but he had
also to catch certain landmarks below, that
would serve to guide him.</p>

<p>Fortune favored him in that he quickly
sighted the lights of a town; and this gave
him the bearings he sought. His mind freed
from further anxiety concerning this matter, he
pushed on once more.</p>

<p>When presently he became aware of the
presence of more lights Jack gave Tom the
signal agreed on between them to mark such a
circumstance. Then the pilot again commenced
to drop to lower levels by a series of easy
volplanes.</p>

<p>Like a huge bird the airplane swept along, now
close to earth. Had one of the peasants who
lived in that region chanced to be aroused by
the rattle of the propeller and thrust his head
out of his cottage door, he must have gazed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
awe to see the vast shadowy form come between
him and the starry heavens, with the light of
the moon silvering its extended wings.</p>

<p>One trip failed to show them just what they
wanted, and so Tom, knowing that the field
must be somewhere in that immediate neighborhood,
immediately swung around and started
in again.</p>

<p>The second search failed to bring success.
Jack began to experience a sensation akin to
dismay. Was their work doomed to meet with
no result and would they find themselves compelled
to start back to Verdun without having
accomplished the important errand on which
they had been dispatched?</p>

<p>It was not Tom Raymond's way to feel discouraged
because things did not always go as
he wished from the start. He believed in the
old motto, "If at first you don't succeed, try,
try again." And he would circle around that
vicinity for a full hour if only in the end he
might find that for which he searched.</p>

<p>Three times however, was the limit. Then
Tom felt certain he had "struck pay dirt"; and
that the opening lying below was the identical
field to which he had been directed.</p>

<p>After that it resolved itself into a simple
landing by moonlight. There were no ready
mechanicians waiting to lend a hand; and everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
must be done by the pilot and his
assistant. But then, all war aviators must be
able to make ordinary repairs if necessary, and
do other duties that usually they allow the
mechanics to perform.</p>

<p>Tom brought the heavy machine to the earth
softly. It was fine work he did, considering
the fact that it was unfamiliar ground he was
striking and the moonlight was far from strong.</p>

<p>They jolted along a short distance, and then
came to a full stop. Jack was the first to spring
out. His first thought was of the strangeness
of being on German soil, far back of the fighting
lines, and within a few miles of Metz, a city of
prime importance.</p>

<p>Hardly had they landed when the air service
boys found themselves listening to sounds that
seemed significant. Plainly came reports of
firearms and of loud shouting, as of excited
men.</p>

<p>"What do you think that row means, Tom?"
asked Jack, as they stood listening with
quickened hearts.</p>

<p>"It's hard to say," the other replied. "They
may be having a riot of some kind over in the
city. But I'm afraid it is more apt to have
something to do with our presence here."</p>

<p>"Do you mean they've seen our dropping
down and that there may be soldiers on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
way here to see what we're up to?" asked
Jack.</p>

<p>"That may turn out to be the truth of it. But
we mustn't lose any more time. What we want
now is that paper. Jack, remember that we
arranged it so you'd stay with the plane, while
I hurried off to get it."</p>

<p>"All right, Tom; only I wish you'd let me go
along. Then if anything happened we'd be
together, anyhow."</p>

<p>"It's better for you to stay here. I'll be gone
only a few minutes if everything turns out
O.K."</p>

<p>Tom turned and ran across the field. Jack
stared after him until he lost track of the runner
in the misty moonlight. Then he occupied himself
in listening to that clamor and wondering
whether it was really getting closer, or if his
fears only made him think so.</p>

<p>There was certainly a big noise. Men
continued to shout, and guns were being
discharged, but not so frequently as before.
Perhaps this latter was done by nervous
guardians of the Lorraine city, who on first
hearing the racket took it for granted that it
meant an airplane attack, and were therefore
starting in to bombard the skies, discovering
hostile fliers in every lurking fleecy cloud.</p>

<p>Yes, Jack was positive now that those who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
shouted to one another must be coming out of
the city, and heading for the big field where
Tom had dropped down.</p>

<p>"Like as not," Jack told himself, "some
wisebody has discovered that airplanes have
been using this ground for alighting. When
they had word that an enemy machine was
heading this way they just naturally concluded
it might drop down here. I guess our little
fight up aloft was heard and understood by
some one on guard. I hope Tom will soon get
back here, that's what!"</p>

<p>Tom had been gone several minutes, and
Jack tried to pierce the misty light beyond in
the endeavor to discover some sign of his returning.
His uneasiness increased, and with
reason, for the noise was drawing perilously
near.</p>

<p>Jack tried to figure out what his plan of
campaign should be in case a motley mob
of citizens and soldiers suddenly appeared in
view, carrying lanterns, and perhaps blazing
torches.</p>

<p>True, he had his automatic pistol with him,
but what would that puny weapon avail when
pitted against a score or two of enemies; many
of them armed soldiers of the Kaiser, who would
ruthlessly fill him with lead at the first show of
resistance on his part?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>Would it be better policy for him to slip
away and conceal himself in case they did
arrive before Tom returned?</p>

<p>But had not Tom explicitly told him to stay
on guard over the airplane until he came back?
Jack drew in a fresh breath. He threw back his
shoulders aggressively and his mind was made
up. He would stick it out, no matter at what
cost. If the Boches wanted that plane they
would have to fight for it, that was all.</p>

<p>He had his pistol out now, and was fondling
it as a child would a pet toy. So far Jack had
fired the weapon only at targets, but he had the
reputation of being a good shot. He believed
he could make every bullet it contained tell.</p>

<p>Then what about the mitrailleuse aboard the
plane? Was it not possible to train it on the
advancing host, and give them such a hot reception
that they would break and race madly
for shelter?</p>

<p>He knew the gun was fixed to shoot straight
ahead. This was the custom with all those who
went up in airplanes. To attempt to fire any
other way would imperil the stability of the
plane, and in many cases bring about sudden
disaster.</p>

<p>Jack fumbled for the fastenings of the airplane
mitrailleuse, it being his intention to
swing the gun free, so that he could turn its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
muzzle in any quarter desired. But it had been
too well secured in place for such a quick
delivery, and presently he gave the idea up as
a bad one.</p>

<p>No Tom yet! Things certainly were taking
on a dark hue, and it looked as though
desperate trouble might be in store for the two
chums. Jack almost believed he could see
dancing lights coming along what might be a
road. He looked again, and no longer had any
doubt on that score.</p>

<p>"Well, a fellow can die only once, and after
all what does it matter whether he meets his
end by falling ten thousand feet from the clouds
or in trying to hold off an angry mob of Teuton
soldiers and citizens of Metz who are in
sympathy with the methods of the Kaiser?"
Jack's reflections served to give him courage.</p>

<p>There was the leading one of the mob, starting
across the dimly lighted field! Jack set his
jaws hard, and determined that he would wait
until the other had come close up. Ammunition
was much too precious to be wasted without
results following.</p>

<p>He was soon glad he had made such a
sensible resolution, for as the runner drew
closer something familiar about his figure and
methods of leaping told Jack it was none other
than Tom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>"Get aboard in a hurry, after you've given
the propellers a swing!" cried Tom, almost
breathless himself after such a sharp run. "I've
got what I wanted."</p>

<p>He was already in his place with his hand on
the control.</p>

<p>"Tell me when, Tom!" sang out Jack.</p>

<p>"Cut loose!" ordered the pilot.</p>

<p>The propellers spun, and the motors commenced
their furious throbbing. Jack swung
aboard, and at once the plane started to roll
along the field, even as men appeared, bursting
into view on one side, and shouting harshly as
they realized how close they had come to
catching those they sought.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>MORE TROUBLE FOR THE CHUMS</span></h2>

<p>It had been a close call for the two air
service boys. Had they been delayed just a
minute or two longer escape might have been
impossible. And to have been caught with the
spy's paper of information in their possession
might have proved a very serious matter.</p>

<p>Some of the mob, that had come from Metz
itself, were German soldiers. They carried guns
with which they opened a hot fire on the
departing plane.</p>

<p>Again the lucky star of Tom and Jack seemed
to be in the ascendant, for they did not receive
even a scratch. Later they found reason to
believe that a number of the leaden missiles had
come very close to their persons; for the marks
upon the body of the plane itself, as well as the
tiny holes in the stout linen covering of the
wings, told where bullets had passed. Possibly,
though, these had come from the rapid-fire gun
handled by the Boche airman.</p>

<p>The plane had left the ground and started to
mount when this shooting occurred, so that the
marksmen had at least had a fair target at
which to fire. But as the departing airplane was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
speeding away from them the rapidly increasing
distance may have disconcerted the Germans.
At any rate they failed to bag their game.</p>

<p>The boys were now mounting upwards again,
filled with joy over their recent escape. Jack
felt sure that Tom had the precious paper; for
he well knew the other would never have
returned so quickly had not success rewarded
his search.</p>

<p>They were soon heading directly for their
distant base. Tom could now give his aerial
steed the rein, and get all the speed possible
out of the cumbersome two-seater. There was
no longer any necessity for "loafing on the job,"
to allow a tardy moon to come in sight, as had
been the case before. Home, and at top speed,
was the slogan now.</p>

<p>But, alas! it was not long before Tom realized
that something was wrong with the plane. He
found it increasingly difficult to manage the
engine, and the machine began to give erratic
jumps that alarmed Jack.</p>

<p>Had it been possible to make himself heard
above the clatter of the motor and the propeller,
Jack would have been much inclined to shout
out, and ask his more experienced comrade
what had happened.</p>

<p>Still he could give a shrewd guess. One of
the bullets fired by the Teuton soldiers must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
have struck some part of the motor, and done
enough damage to make its workings exceedingly
erratic. If such were the case, would it
be wise for them to try to push on at this high
altitude, where a sudden collapse would mean
death for both of the occupants of the disabled
plane?</p>

<p>Tom soon shut the motor off, and tilted the
machine for a volplane down several thousand
feet to a new level.</p>

<p>Jack held his breath. This was partly
because the wind rushed at him in a vicious
fashion while they were plunging downward,
and also on account of a new fear that clutched
his heart.</p>

<p>How about the wings of the airplane standing
the strain when Tom suddenly brought
that volplane to a stop and tried to sail on an
even keel again? Would they hold out? Or
had some defect occurred in them which could
also be charged to the spattering bullets fired
by the Metz mob?</p>

<p>Then Jack breathed easier again.</p>

<p>The thing had been accomplished, and they
were once more speeding onward, as Tom
touched the controls that started the motor
working. All then was well, as far as they had
gone. Apparently they could by successive
stages descend close to the treetops, and skim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
along until some favorable open space showed,
into which a skillful pilot would find it possible
to drop lightly and land.</p>

<p>A second volplane further added to Jack's
peace of mind. They were now halfway down,
and all seemed well. The earth loomed up
below, although as yet it took on only a vague,
misty effect, due to the weak moonlight.</p>

<p>Jack busied himself in trying to make things
out, as for the third time the nose of the heavy
observation Caudron was suddenly pointed
downward, and they took the next "header."</p>

<p>This time Tom dropped a greater distance.
When once more the loud hum of motor and
propellers was heard they had almost reached
the treetops. Jack gave one gulp, in fear lest
his pilot could not make things work as he intended,
and that they must crash to the earth
while descending at such frightful speed.</p>

<p>Now everything was all right. They could
not be more than a thousand feet above the
floor of the valley they were following in their
homeward route. If anything happened surely
Tom would find some way of making a landing,
even if a clumsy one that would put their
machine out of the running and leave them
stranded on enemy soil.</p>

<p>They continued to move along slowly, both
looking eagerly to discover signs that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
invite a possible landing. It looked as though
they were in the country; at least they did not
discover any signs of lights to indicate the
presence of houses near by.</p>

<p>Soon a landing proved feasible, as they came
to just the kind of open plot the air service boys
yearned to discover. To make absolutely certain
before committing himself, Tom circled the
ground twice, and even dropped lower and
lower while so doing, all the while straining his
vision to the utmost.</p>

<p>Then the thing was done.</p>

<p>That was far from a pleasant landing. It
shook them up considerably; but Jack was of
the opinion that no damage resulted to the airplane,
which after all was just then the main
consideration.</p>

<p>Both of them leaped to the ground, after
which Tom secured his electric hand-torch
which he had found useful so many times while
on the outward trip and he wished to consult
the compass or the register of the barograph.</p>

<p>"I guess there's some sort of a house near
by," said Jack, "because a rooster crowed over
yonder. Yes, I can see what looks like the line
of a road, too. I suppose it runs the entire
length of this valley."</p>

<p>While Jack was saying this softly the pilot
had started to take an inventory of the motor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
His now practiced eye ran along this and that
part, each of which was so essential to the
smooth running of the engine. Tom too had
already formed a pretty clear idea as to where
he was likely to find the damage, and hence was
able in a short time to give a satisfied grunt.</p>

<p>"Located the trouble, have you, Tom?"
queried the other.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's right where I expected to find it.
A bullet has made a dent that interferes with
the free action of the part. Besides, I think
that spark plug has become fouled with oil, and
will have to be changed to get the best results."</p>

<p>"How lucky you brought another with you!
Lots of fellows wouldn't have bothered about
such a little thing."</p>

<p>"I had my suspicions about that when we
started," explained the other, "even though the
mechanician assured me it was perfectly clean.
I know different now, and will certainly give
him a piece of my mind when we get back."</p>

<p>"Then you expect to get home safely, do
you?" asked Jack, in a relieved tone, that
proved how anxious he had been growing since
troubles had so consecutively alighted on them.</p>

<p>"Surely," chuckled the other, with his usual
confidence in voice and manner, "a thing like
this isn't going to stop our plans. Here in this
retired spot nobody's apt to bother us while we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
make our repairs. You can hold this torch,
Jack, and shove the light squarely on the work."</p>

<p>Tom worked for some time. He tapped as
gently as possible when knocking out the dent
made by the bullet, and he gradually removed
the cause of the trouble. He was just finishing
with the spark-plug when the confidence of the
air service boys received a sudden jolt.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LONE HOUSE BY THE ROADSIDE</span></h2>

<p>"Listen, Tom!" hissed Jack.</p>

<p>The other had just sighed with relief on
completing the work of replacing the spark-plug
that had become fouled with oil.</p>

<p>"I, too, heard it plainly, Jack!" he breathed.</p>

<p>"Was it someone screaming or sobbing?"
asked the other breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Sounded like it to me."</p>

<p>"And either a woman or a girl, at that!"
hazarded his chum in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"It might have been a boy," suggested Tom.
"There it is again."</p>

<p>Both of them listened. Peculiar sensations
crept over them as they stood and thus strained
their ears to catch any further sounds. Sobbing
at any time is enough to arouse the feelings of
a sensitive nature; but heard in the dead of
night, and under the conditions that surrounded
the two young aviators, made it all the more
thrilling.</p>

<p>Jack in particular was touched to the heart.</p>

<p>"Say, that's a queer thing, Tom!" he muttered.
"Why should anybody be crying or
screaming like that away off here, and at this
time of night?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>"Oh, there are many who are weeping in
these dark days," said Tom gravely. "The men
in myriads of families will never come home
again. Perhaps a mother, or it may be a sister,
has just had word that son, father, or brother
has been shot down in battle."</p>

<p>Jack shuddered. Why should his thoughts
instantly fly to the Boche pilot whom they had
met and fought and conquered while on the
way to Metz on their present perilous mission?
It had been a fair fight, and a case of their lives
or his. Nevertheless Jack shuddered as he
remembered how the other had gone down after
that last exchange of gunfire.</p>

<p>"Tom, notice that it comes from almost the
identical direction where I told you I heard the
crowing of a rooster a while ago," he hastened
to say, more to rid his mind of those ghastly
thoughts than anything else.</p>

<p>What a strange fatality if this should be the
home of the unfortunate Teuton pilot of that
Fokker machine, and the one who mourned was
his mother or a young sister, or perhaps his
wife!</p>

<p>"That means there's a house not far away,
possibly an estate of some kind," mused Tom,
as though turning over some sudden project in
his mind.</p>

<p>Jack guessed what his chum was thinking
about.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>"Tom," he said softly, when for the third
time they caught the heart-rending, half stifled
sobs coming on the still night air.</p>

<p>"What do you want now, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I was just wondering whether you'd agree
to something," continued the other, in a
persuasive tone. "We're not in any <i>great</i> hurry,
are we?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, perhaps not, Jack; though I'd like
to deliver the paper into the hands of our
commander as soon as possible. It is probably of
the utmost importance, you know."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking how I'd feel, Tom, if
my mother or sister were in some great trouble,
and fellows who might be in a position to hold
out a helping hand considered their own
personal safety first."</p>

<p>When Jack said this his voice was husky.
Apparently the incident appealed strongly to his
emotions. Jack had always been unusually
thoughtful in regard to women of whatever age
or degree, and would go far out of his way to
do one a favor; so it was not strange that he
should feel as he did at this time.</p>

<p>Tom was in a mood to be easily persuaded.
The plaintive sobs, telling of woe that clutched
some one's heart-strings, stirred a responsive
chord within him. He, too, remembered those
at home. Jack had put a clincher on his argument
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
when he asked what their opinion of a man
would be who turned aside and went his own
way after hearing a woman or a child crying
bitterly.</p>

<p>"All right, then, Jack; perhaps we can spare
the time to take a turn around here, and see if
we can be of any help," he announced, greatly
to the satisfaction of his chum.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some one has been hurt and needs
assistance," suggested Jack. "It isn't going to
delay us much, and may be of great help to
them. Come on&#8211;let's be on the move."</p>

<p>Tom was not quite so precipitate as his companion.
Caution had a part in his make-up.</p>

<p>"Don't try to rush things, Jack," he said. "I
must take a last look over my work here, you
know."</p>

<p>"But you said everything was completed,
Tom!" persisted the other.</p>

<p>"So it is, but I ought to make doubly sure
before we leave the plane," Tom added, as he
took the electric hand-torch from his companion
and began systematically to look over the
engine at which he had been working, carefully
examining every detail.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing further. He understood
what his chum meant when he declared it important
that they should know absolutely the
motor was in prime condition for immediate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
service. Something might occur to necessitate
a hurried departure from the vicinity; a detachment
of the enemy forces might appear, or other
perils hover over their heads that might be
laughed at only if they could take to the air
without detention.</p>

<p>Tom was not long in doing as he desired.
Meanwhile Jack could hear an occasional sob
from the same quarter as before, and the sounds
continued to exercise a peculiar influence over
him which he could not have explained had he
been asked.</p>

<p>"I'm ready now, Jack!".</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," muttered the other, half
under his breath; not that he meant to infer
Tom had been unduly long, but because his
feelings were wrought up to a high pitch that
caused him to quiver all over.</p>

<p>Tom evidently guessed this, judging from his
next remark.</p>

<p>"Cool down, Jack," he said, laying a hand on
his companion's arm. "This will never do, you
know. Getting excited is the worst thing an
air pilot can do. It'll prove fatal to all your
hopes, unless you manage to control your feelings
better."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Tom."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any chance the plane
will be discovered here in the open field, even if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
there is a road so close by," mused the pilot,
after they had gone perhaps as far as twenty-five
yards.</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years," asserted Jack confidently,
turning to look back as he spoke.
"Why, even now I can't discover a sign of the
wings, or anything else in the misty moonlight,
it's so deceptive. Only that lone tree standing
close to where we dropped tells me the location
of our plane."</p>

<p>"Yes, I marked that, too," asserted Tom
quietly. "I thought we ought to have some
sort of landmark to guide us if we should be
in a hurry coming back. And the tree, standing
up fairly high, can be seen ten times better
than anything close to the earth."</p>

<p>"Here's the road, Tom."</p>

<p>"So it is, and an important one in the bargain,
judging from its condition," remarked the
other, softly.</p>

<p>"It runs the length of the valley, of course,"
added Jack. "I shouldn't be surprised if it went
all the way from Metz to the Verdun front.
If that's the case it must have considerable
travel, even if nothing has chanced to come
along since we landed."</p>

<p>"I can see signs to tell that we are close to
some sort of country estate, or it may only be
a Lorraine farm."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>"I can glimpse lights through the trees, and
chances are they come from windows in the
house beyond."</p>

<p>"I see them too," affirmed Tom.</p>

<p>"But say, isn't it pretty late for a farmhouse
to be lighted up like that?"</p>

<p>"Depend on it, there's some good reason for
all that illumination," Jack was told. "And
perhaps we'd better drop this talking so much,
now we're getting close to the place. No telling
what we'll find there. For all we know
this may be some one's headquarters, though
pretty far back of the line for that sort of thing.
But I think it'll turn out to be something more
than ordinary."</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>Jack began to weave all manner of fantastic
explanations to account for the illumination of
the house alongside the road to Metz.</p>

<p>He felt he would not be very much astonished
to discover a line of military cars standing
at the gate, and find that an important council
of war was being conducted within the building.</p>

<p>Then he remembered the crying and sobbing.
Somehow, that did not seem to fit in with his
other imaginings. The touch of Tom's hand
on his arm made Jack give a violent start.</p>

<p>"Here's a high fence, you notice," Tom
whispered. "Seeing that makes me believe it's
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
going to turn out to be a country estate, and
not just a farm. We ought to find a gate somewhere
further along."</p>

<p>"That crying has stopped, Tom."</p>

<p>"For the time being, yes," admitted the other.
"Perhaps she's only gone away from the open
window. I was in hopes it would keep on, so
we could be guided straight."</p>

<p>Two minutes later, after walking alongside
the high fence for some distance, they discovered
the entrance to the place. Tom flashed
his light on the ground.</p>

<p>"Been considerable going in and coming
out of vehicles, generally automobiles," he
announced.</p>

<p>"And private cars are almost taboo in all
Germany these dark days, they tell us," mentioned
Jack sagely. "That makes it look as if
some sort of military business might be transacted
in this isolated place. Gee! I tell you it's
getting my curiosity whetted to a fine point,
all this mystery. But we're going in, of course,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"Some way or other, Jack. If the entrance
is closed and locked we can climb over the
fence, all right. But no need of worrying about
that, because I already see the gates are ajar.
Come on."</p>

<p>So they slipped into the enclosed grounds,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
actuated by an impulse, wholly unconscious of
what might be awaiting them. They had been
drawn into the adventure simply on account
of a praiseworthy desire to be of service to
some unknown one who seemed to be in
trouble. And neither of the boys even vaguely
suspected as yet what strange happenings would
confront them before many minutes passed by.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEST OF SPIES</span></h2>

<p>Neither of the air service boys had any
doubts now with regard to the character of
the grounds they were invading at dead of
night. It must be a private estate. Once it
may have been kept up through a lavish expenditure
of money, but of late years things
had evidently been allowed to grow more or
less wild.</p>

<p>Tom was following what appeared to be the
drive. It was not difficult to do so, because
of the moonlight that sifted down through the
bare branches of the neighboring ornamental
trees, now destitute of foliage.</p>

<p>The house was presently discovered. Just as
Tom anticipated, it was a rather large building,
that might even be called a mansion, or
ch√¢teau. It lay half buried amidst a prodigious
growth of trees and bushes.</p>

<p>Jack fancied there was a sort of haunted air
about the place, something uncanny, as he told
himself. And then those sobs or screams could
not be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Let's go around first, and see what lies in
the rear," whispered Tom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>He had an object in view when he said this.
Having noted carefully their route in coming
from the open field where they had left their
big plane, Tom knew that the window from
whence the sobbing had come must be either
at the back of the house, or on the eastern side.</p>

<p>He was heading in that quarter now, and
looking for signs of a light in some upper
window. This he discovered speedily, and
pointed it out to his companion.</p>

<p>"Whoever was crying, Jack, must be up
there," he said, close to the other's ear so as
to insure safety.</p>

<p>"But how can we find out?" queried Jack.
"If you say the word I'm willing to climb up,
and learn what's wrong."</p>

<p>"Not yet. We must take a turn around, and
pick up more knowledge of this place, as well
as the people who live in the house."</p>

<p>"Then why not creep up and look in at that
lower window?" suggested Jack, pointing as he
spoke. "I've seen a shadow passing back and
forth, as if some person were walking up and
down like a caged tiger. It's a man, too, Tom,
because I could easily make out his figure, a
tall man to boot."</p>

<p>Tom led the way, with Jack at his heels.
They managed to crawl through the bushes
that cluttered the ground close to the wall of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
the stone building, and were at length in a
position to raise themselves from their knees
and peep under the drawn shade.</p>

<p>Jack was the first to look. Almost instantly
he drew back with a low ejaculation of wonder.
Tom, spurred on by this fact, also raised his
head until his eyes were on a level with the
small strip of open space just below the shade.
He too had a thrill at what he saw.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I must be dreaming!" whispered
Jack huskily. "Tell me, is that man in there
really Carl Potzfeldt, the good-for-nothing
guardian of little Bessie Gleason?"</p>

<p>"It's no other than our old acquaintance of
the Atlantic liner," admitted Tom, though he
himself had some difficulty in believing the
startling fact.</p>

<p>This man, whom they felt sure was a German
spy, had last been seen descending the gangway
from the steamer at an English port, with
Bessie Gleason, his pretty little ward, held by
the hand, as though he feared she might try to
run away from him.</p>

<p>Many times had Jack tried to picture the
conditions under which he might run across
Carl Potzfeldt again; but no matter what line
of flight his imagination took he certainly had
never dreamed of such a thing as this. Here
in the heart of Lorraine, many miles back of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
the German front, on a moonlight night, and
in a lonely country house, he once more beheld
the object of his former detestation.</p>

<p>He clutched his chum by the arm almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>"Well, that settles it, Tom!" he muttered
savagely.</p>

<p>"Settles what?" whispered the other, for the
window was closed, and there did not seem to
be any chance of their low-voiced exchange of
opinions being overheard.</p>

<p>"I don't leave here until I've seen <i>her</i>. For
if he's at this place it stands to reason Bessie
must be here also. Tom, that was Bessie we
heard sobbing, I just know it now."</p>

<p>Tom had already jumped to the same conclusion.
Nevertheless he did not mean to let
it interfere with his customary caution. Nothing
was to be gained through reckless and hurried
action. They must go slowly and carefully.
This house by the roadside on the way to Metz
he concluded might be a nest of spies, perhaps
the headquarters of a vast network of plotters.</p>

<p>"Hark! There's a car coming along the road
and stopping at the gates here!" he told his
chum, as he drew Jack down beside him. "We
must be more careful how we look in lighted
windows. If any one chanced to be abroad in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
the grounds we'd be seen, and perhaps fired
on."</p>

<p>They crept from the vicinity of the window.
Tom led the way toward the front of the house,
as if he had an object in view. The car was
now coming in along the crooked drive. They
could see its one light, for economy in the use
of all means for illumination was a cardinal
feature of the German military orders in those
days of scarcity.</p>

<p>The car stopped in front of the house, and a
man jumped out. Tom saw that he wore a
uniform of some sort, and judged that he might
be a captain, at least. There was a second
figure on the front seat, also in the dark-green
garb of a soldier, but a private possibly.</p>

<p>The two young Americans crouched amidst
the dense bushes and listened. So many thrilling
things were happening in rapid succession
that their pulses beat with unwonted speed.</p>

<p>Before this the sound of the approaching car
must have reached the ears of the man they had
seen pacing the floor in the spacious room that
looked like a library. There were many books
in cases and on shelves, while pictures and
boars' heads decorated the walls.</p>

<p>Potzfeldt opened the door just as the officer
alighted, and there was an exchange of stiff
military salutations. Tom discovered that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
guess was a true one, for the man of the house
addressed the other as "Captain."</p>

<p>It was too bad that they spoke in German
as they stood by the open door. Jack for once
bitterly regretted the fact that he had never
taken up the study of that language when at
school, as he might have done easily enough.
It would have paid him handsomely just then,
he believed.</p>

<p>The two men talked rapidly. Apparently the
officer was asking questions, and demanding
something, for in another minute Carl Potzfeldt
took an object out of a bill book and
handed it to the other. As near as the watchers
could make out this object was a slip of paper,
very small, but handled as though it might be
exceedingly precious.</p>

<p>Jack had a sudden recollection of a correspondingly
minute slip of paper which he and
Tom had found hidden in that little receptacle
attached to the leg of the homing pigeon the
latter had shot.</p>

<p>More talk followed between the two men.
Presently the man turned and hastened inside
again. He had left the door standing open,
however, with the German officer waiting as if
for something he had come after besides the
scrap of paper.</p>

<p>Jack knew now that the man in uniform was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
from the headquarters of the Crown Prince.
That accounted for the numerous marks of car tires
which Tom had discovered on the drive.
This lonely house by the roadside on the way
to Metz was a nest of spies. Perhaps Carl
Potzfeldt might be the chief, through whom
negotiations were conducted and lesser agents
sent forth.</p>

<p>Jack had got no further in his deduction
when he saw the tall man returning. He
carried a bundle that was wrapped in a cloth,
and depended from his hand by means of a
heavy cord, or some sort of handle.</p>

<p>This he set down on the landing, while he
passed further words with the captain; and now
it was Potzfeldt who asked the questions, as
though he wished to learn how things were
going at the front.</p>

<p>Between queries and guttural replies the hidden
air service boys heard a series of sounds
that gave them sudden light. Jack's hand
pressed on Tom's arm, as though in this manner
he wished to call the attention of the other to
the noise.</p>

<p>Many times both of them had listened to
similar sounds while watching some pigeon on
the barn roof dare a rival to combat, or when
wooing his mate. And as they could easily
trace this to the covered package which Carl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
Potzfeldt had just brought out of the house,
the meaning was obvious.</p>

<p>Of course there were pigeons in that cage,
homing pigeons at that, like the one Tom had
shot! Doubtless had that one escaped its tragic
fate the message it carried would have been
delivered to the owner of this lonely house, in
turn to be handed over to one of the messengers
from German headquarters.</p>

<p>And now the German captain, stooping over,
took possession of the cage containing at least
two of the trained birds. They would be carried
to some point from which, on another
night, a daring Boche airman would attempt to
take them far back of the French front, to hand
over to the agent who was in communication
with the master spy, Carl Potzfeldt.</p>

<p>It was all very simple. Nevertheless it was
also amazing to realize how by what might be
called a freak of fate the air service boys had
been enabled to discover these facts. But for
the accident to the motor they would not have
dreamed of making a landing short of the aviation
field at Bar-le-Duc. Then, had they not
caught that woeful sound of loud sobbing, the
idea of looking around would never have occurred
to them.</p>

<p>The officer was now starting back to his car,
which would carry him post-haste to German
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
headquarters, where the fresh message in a
cipher code from beyond the French lines might
be translated, and the valuable information it
possibly contained be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>Presently the military chauffeur started to
swing around a curve that would allow them to
leave the grounds by the same gates through
which they had entered. The car's course
could be followed by the strong ray its one
light threw ahead; and the boys were able to
tell when it reached the road again.</p>

<p>As they expected it returned the same way it
had come, probably heading for the headquarters
of the Crown Prince.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>JACK CLIMBS A WALL</span></h2>

<p>"What luck we're in to be here, Tom!"
murmured Jack.</p>

<p>Carl Potzfeldt had again entered the house
and closed the door; and the air service boys
could no longer hear the car speeding along
the road. Jack was quivering all over with
excitement. The events that had just come to
their attention filled him with a sensation of
wonder approaching awe.</p>

<p>"It certainly is strange how we've stumbled
on this nest of spies," admitted Tom.</p>

<p>"And the paper he gave the captain&#8211;it
must have been a message in cipher that an
incoming pigeon brought from back of our
lines, eh, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I guess it was, Jack. We could see it was
only a small scrap of paper, thin paper at that;
but both of them handled it as if it were pretty
valuable."</p>

<p>Jack was chuckling, such a queer proceeding
that Tom could not help noticing it, and
commenting on it.</p>

<p>"What's struck you as funny now?" he asked,
puzzled to account for this sudden freak on the
part of his companion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>"I was wondering," explained Jack, "whether
that mightn't be the doctored message we believed
our commander meant to send through
some time or other with one of the pigeons we
got that day we went hunting."</p>

<p>"That's possible," Tom agreed, also amused
at the thought. "But then, whether it is or not,
it means nothing to us, you understand. We
are here, and must decide on our movements.
If that was a bogus message, and will coax the
Germans to make an attack at a certain place
where a trap has been laid, that's their lookout."</p>

<p>"Somewhere about here must be the pigeon
loft where those homing birds have been bred,"
suggested Jack, following up a train of thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, it may be on the flat roof of the
ch√¢teau, or in the barn at the rear," Tom
admitted. "One thing is certain, they know
only this place as home; and wherever they're
set free their first instinct is to strike a bee-line
for here. Some people are so foolish as to fancy
homers can be sent anywhere; but that's silly.
It's only home that they're able to head straight
toward, even if hundreds of miles away."</p>

<p>"Oh Tom! how about Bessie?" inquired Jack
eagerly.</p>

<p>His chum considered, while he rubbed his
chin with thumb and finger in a thoughtful way
he had when a little puzzled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>"It might be done in a pinch," he finally
muttered.</p>

<p>"What, Tom?"</p>

<p>"She's such a little mite that her weight
wouldn't amount to much, if only she had the
nerve to do it, Jack."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you'd be willing to carry
Bessie off with us? To help her escape from
her guardian? I'm sure he must be treating her
badly, or else she wouldn't be sobbing her poor
little heart out, as we heard her."</p>

<p>"That would have to depend a whole lot on
Bessie."</p>

<p>"As far as that goes I know she's a gritty
little person," Jack instantly remarked. "Many
times she said to me she wished she were a boy
so that she might also learn to fly and fight for
France against the detested Kaiser. Why, she
even told me she had gone up with an aviator
who exhibited down at a Florida resort, one
having a hydro-airplane in which he took
people up. And Bessie declared she didn't have
the least fear."</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me, Jack."</p>

<p>"Then let's get busy, and try to let her
know we're here," continued Jack.</p>

<p>"First of all, we'll get under the open window
where she must have been standing at the time
we heard her crying. I think I saw a movement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
up there while the two men were
conversing on the porch. Perhaps Bessie was
listening to what they said."</p>

<p>Tom's words gave his chum a new thought.</p>

<p>"Oh, it would certainly be just like Bessie
to do it! She seemed to be full of clever ideas."</p>

<p>Tom, being mystified by such words, he
naturally sought further information.</p>

<p>"What would she do?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Send me that mysterious message by the
little hot-air balloon," Jack announced with a
vein of pride in his voice, feeling delighted
over having solved the puzzle that had baffled
him for so long.</p>

<p>"It hardly seems probable," Tom answered
softly. "At the same time it isn't altogether
impossible."</p>

<p>"How far are we from the French front, do
you think, Tom?" pursued his comrade, determined
to sift the whole thing out.</p>

<p>"Twenty miles or so, I should imagine."</p>

<p>"That isn't very far. Once I caught just
such a little balloon in a tree in our yard that
had a tag on it, telling that it had been set
free in a village that lay <i>seventy</i> miles off. The
wind had carried it along furiously, so that
it covered all that distance before losing
buoyancy, and coming down in the heavy night
air."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>"Yes, I know of other circumstances where
such balloons have traveled long distances
before falling. Then again, Jack, this valley
extends pretty much all the way to the Verdun
front, and the current of air would carry a
balloon along directly toward our home patch."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bessie sent it, believe me!" asserted
Jack again, more confidently than ever. "And
she'll tell us so too, when she gets the chance."</p>

<p>Thus whispering the air service boys arrived
at that side of the house where the lighted
window on the second floor seemed to indicate
that the object of their present concern could
be found.</p>

<p>Tom examined the building as well as the
limited amount of light allowed. He could
easily see that any agile young fellow, himself
or Jack for instance, might scale the wall,
making use of some projections, and a cement
flower trellis as well, in carrying out the
project.</p>

<p>"We might throw pebbles up, and bring her
to the window," he suggested, though pretty
confident at the time Jack would find fault with
such an arrangement.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't help her get down here to
us, Tom," protested the other. "And that's
what we're planning, you remember; for you
said she could accompany us if she felt equal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
to it. I must go up myself and help Bessie
get down. There's nothing else to do, Tom."</p>

<p>It looked very much as though Jack was
right. Tom admitted this to himself; at the
same time he wished there were some other
way by means of which the same end could
be gained, or that he could undertake the thing,
instead of his comrade.</p>

<p>But to this Jack would never agree. Bessie
was his own particular friend; and they had
been most "chummy" while aboard the Atlantic
liner crossing the submarine infested ocean.
Then again that warning had been addressed
to him, and not to both, showing that the
writer had only been concerned about the
danger he, Jack, was running, should his plane
be tampered with by some emissary of Carl
Potzfeldt.</p>

<p>"All right then; you go, Jack! But be careful
about your footing. If you fell it'd be a
bad thing in many ways, for even if you escaped
a broken neck or a fractured leg you'd
arouse the house, and all sorts of trouble would
drop down on us in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, Tom. I'll show you
I'm as nimble as any monkey. Besides, that
isn't much of a climb. Why, I could nearly do
it with one arm tied fast."</p>

<p>"Go to it!" Tom told him, settling back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
watch the performance and give whispered advice
if it seemed necessary.</p>

<p>Jack waited no longer. He was wild to find
himself once more face to face with the pretty
young girl in whom he had taken such an
interest. Her recent sobs and cries still haunted
his heart, and he felt certain she must be in
great sorrow over something.</p>

<p>He commenced climbing. While his boast
about being equal to any monkey that ever
lived among the treetops may have been a bit
of an exaggeration, all the same Jack was a
very good athlete, and especially with regard
to feats on the parallel bars or the ladders in
a gymnasium.</p>

<p>He made his way nimbly upward, with Tom's
eyes following every movement. It seemed an
easy task for the climber. Just what he would
discover when he had gained the open window
was another question.</p>

<p>The light still remained, for which both boys
felt glad. It afforded Jack a goal which he
was striving to gain; and it told Tom further
down that the inmate of the upper room was
awake and still moving about, though her sobs
had ceased.</p>

<p>Once Tom fancied he heard something
stirring back of the house. He hoped it might
not prove to be a servant attached to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
Potzfeldt place or an attendant who had charge
of the pigeon loft.</p>

<p>Jack was almost up now. He had only to
cover another yard of space when he could
look into the room of the lighted window.
That was where fresh peril must lie, because his
figure would be outlined in silhouette, and any
one moving about the grounds might discover
that uninvited guests had arrived.</p>

<p>Tom wished he had told his chum to insist
that the light be immediately extinguished, if,
as they believed, it proved to be Bessie who
occupied that room. He hoped his chum would
think of it without being told.</p>

<p>There! At last Jack had arrived, and without
accident! Now he was cautiously thrusting his
head up a little, to peer within.</p>

<p>Tom held his breath. So much depended on
what would follow Jack's betrayal of his
presence.</p>

<p>"Tell her to put out the light, first of all,
Jack!" Tom gently called out, using both hands
as a megaphone to carry the sounds.</p>

<p>It seemed that he must have been heard,
and his directions understood, for immediately
there was another movement above, after which
the illumination ceased, as though Bessie had
blown out the lamp.</p>

<p>Tom breathed easier, though he still continued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
to look, and wonder how his chum was
going to get the girl safely down from her
elevated apartment. Jack was not so fertile in
expedients as his chum, and many times
depended on Tom to suggest ways and means.</p>

<p>While Tom was still waiting, and hoping for
the best, he heard his comrade whisper down
to him as he hung suspended, clutching the sill
of the open window.</p>

<p>"After all, you'll have to come up too, Tom,"
he was saying feverishly. "There are complications
that'll need your judgment, knots to
untangle that are beyond me."</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE OLD LORRAINE CH√ÇTEAU</span></h2>

<p>What Jack said in his cautious fashion
puzzled Tom. For the life of him he could
not understand what had arisen, calling for any
unusual display of generalship. Surely Jack
should have been equal to the task of getting
Bessie down from the window, even if he had
to make use of knotted bed-clothes in lieu of
a rope.</p>

<p>Still he had asked Tom to come up, and there
was nothing to do but grant his request.
"Complications," Jack said, had arisen. That
was a suggestive word, and to Tom's mind
seemed to hint at further mystery.</p>

<p>Accordingly he proceeded to imitate the
example of his comrade. Jack had shown the
way, and all his chum had to do was to follow.
As Tom was also an all-around athlete,
accustomed to much climbing from small boyhood,
after nuts and birds' nests and all such
things as take lads into tall trees, he found
but little trouble in making the ascent.</p>

<p>When he drew himself alongside Jack, the
other gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>"Whee! I'm glad you've come, I tell you,
Tom," he said. "It was getting too big a job
for me to tackle."</p>

<p>"What's happened, Jack?" asked the late
arrival on the stone ledge under the window
of the upper room.</p>

<p>"First, here's Bessie, Tom," Jack went on.
"She wants to shake hands with you. Since
we parted, when the steamer was docked, the
poor girl has been having all sorts of trouble;
and she's glad as can be to see us both again;
aren't you, Bessie?"</p>

<p>Tom, feeling a small, trembling hand groping
for his, immediately grasped it, and gave a
squeeze that must have carried conviction to
the heart of the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm shivering like everything!" she
murmured, adding quickly: "But not with fear.
It's because my prayers have been answered,
and help has come at last, when everything
looked so awfully dark&#8211;and I'm so very, very
hungry."</p>

<p>"Hungry!" repeated Tom, starting, it seemed
such a very strange word for the girl to use,
even though they were in Germany, where all
food he knew must be getting exceedingly
scarce.</p>

<p>"Yes, what do you think, that rotten bounder
of a spy is half starving the poor girl! He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
ought to be tarred and feathered, that's what!"
growled the indignant Jack.</p>

<p>"Not so loud," warned Tom. "Some one
may hear you, Jack. But tell me what you've
learned."</p>

<p>"Why, first of all, Tom, it was Bessie who
wrote that warning message I had, and attached
it to that little balloon, hoping the favorable
breeze would carry it over the front to the
French lines. So that mystery is explained.
Then, Tom, there are <i>two</i> we've got to take
out of this place, instead of just one, as we
thought."</p>

<p>"I don't get you!" Tom ejaculated. "What
do you mean by two?"</p>

<p>"It's a story in itself, I guess," whispered
Jack. "I don't wholly understand it myself.
But it seems that Bessie's mother didn't drown
after all when the <i>Lusitania</i> went down, as
Potzfeldt reported she did."</p>

<p>"You surprise me, Jack! How could that
be?" demanded the other youth, thrilled by the
startling information.</p>

<p>"Oh, that slick rascal managed it somehow,"
came the soft if indignant reply. "We'll learn
more about it later on. He was picked up
by a fishing boat. The lady was temporarily
out of her mind, so he gave it out later that
she had gone down. How he ever got her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
over here in Germany beats me. But he
managed to do it it seems. And she's been
kept a prisoner in this old ch√¢teau of his ever
since!"</p>

<p>"But what was his object?" asked the
amazed Tom.</p>

<p>"It had a heap to do with finances," Jack
told him. "While he held a paper that gave
him charge over her daughter over in America,
and a part of the big Gleason fortune also,
there were valuable papers he had been unable
to get his greedy hands on. She absolutely
refused to tell him where they were hidden.
As a last resort what did the wretch do but
go all the way back to America."</p>

<p>"You mean to fetch his ward across with
him, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just to use Bessie as a lever to compel
her mother to give up those valuable papers.
I always said, you remember, Tom, that man
was hugging some secret to his heart. And so
he was."</p>

<p>"He's been treating Bessie badly then, half
starving her, I think you said?" continued Tom.</p>

<p>"Just what he has, poor girl," growled his
chum, savagely. "It's an awful thing to be
hungry! I don't see how any one can stand
it. But he hasn't broken the spirit of either
of them yet, though Bessie's getting so weak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
she finds herself crying every now and then,
just as we heard her. And it was that which
brought us over to find out what it meant.
But Tom, tell her we mean to stand by, and
see that both her mother and herself are taken
to a place of safety."</p>

<p>This Tom readily did, though as yet he could
hardly understand just how their promise could
be fulfilled. One they might manage to take
aloft with them, by crowding, but the Caudron
was not capable of seating four; nor would it
be safe to carry a couple of inexperienced
passengers along with themselves.</p>

<p>"But we're losing valuable time," he observed.
"The sooner we get in touch with Mrs. Gleason
the better. There's a whole lot to be done
before we can say we're on the safe side of
the fence."</p>

<p>"Then first of all we'd better climb inside the
room, hadn't we?" suggested Jack.</p>

<p>In answer Tom proceeded to get one leg
over the sill, and then pass his entire body
across. Jack quickly followed. In the semi-darkness,
for the moon gave a dim light, they
clustered there, and continued to map out
their immediate plans in whispers that could
not have been heard a dozen feet distant.</p>

<p>It appeared that Bessie knew where her
mother was confined, though both doors were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
fastened on the outside to prevent their having
communication. But the girl had found a way.
Night after night she was accustomed to
slipping from her window, when everything was
quiet below and the lights all out, making her
way along that narrow coping, or ledge, and
tapping softly at the window of her mother's
room.</p>

<p>They would remain together until toward
morning, when the girl made it a practice to
return by the same perilous route.</p>

<p>On this particular night it had seemed as
though the lights below would never go out.
Carl Potzfeldt, the master spy, expecting
important news and a messenger from the
headquarters of the Crown Prince, had been
waiting up until long after midnight in order
to fullfil the important duties entrusted to him.</p>

<p>Jack suggested that he creep along that
coping and inform the lady of the golden chance
for escape that had arrived. But as she would
hardly be able to return by the same way, it
seemed as though some other scheme must
be considered.</p>

<p>Bessie herself had a brilliant thought bordering
on an inspiration.</p>

<p>"Listen, and I will tell you," she said at
this juncture. "All the time I have been here
my one thought has been of escape. I dreamed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
nothing else save getting my poor mother away
from the clutches of that coward who had
hypnotized her in the past, and made her believe
he was a good man as well as her cousin from
Alsace-Lorraine. And I know of a way it can
be done."</p>

<p>"Tell us your plan, please," begged Jack;
though he would be sorry to learn that the
honor of releasing Bessie's imprisoned mother
was not to fall to his share in the undertaking.</p>

<p>"There is another window. It opens upon
a hallway; and I can get through it, because
I've tried it more than once. But the proper
time hadn't come, for how were we to flee from
this awful country? Wait for me here, both
of you. I shall be able to open her barred
door, and then my own. And it is better that
I carry her the good news than some one who
would be a stranger to my mother, however
much I have told her about you."</p>

<p>Tom saw that her plan was the best, after
all. He himself had been a little afraid that
if Jack came tapping at the window of Mrs.
Gleason's room she might take the alarm,
thinking it but another twist to the odious
schemes of Potzfeldt, and perhaps shrieking
out in terror, which would cause an alarm, and
ruin everything.</p>

<p>Bessie climbed nimbly out of the window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
showing how accustomed she was to such
athletic exercises. Jack held on to her to the
last, and his whispers were all of an entreating
character, as he begged her to be very careful,
and not slip in her excitement.</p>

<p>Now she was gone, and the two air service
boys, left by themselves in that room of the old
Lorraine ch√¢teau, counted the seconds and the
minutes until they should hear a gentle signal
at the door, to signify that Bessie and her
mother were there, about to enter.</p>

<p>Jack walked softly up and down, like a
velvet-footed tiger in its cage. He was so
worked up by the excitement of the occasion
that Tom did not have the heart to ask him
to stop his movements, though he certainly
would have done so had not the other been
keeping on his tiptoes all the while.</p>

<p>What a remarkable turn their venture into the
country back of the enemy's lines had taken!
And what astounding discoveries they had made
in the bargain!</p>

<p>Jack was getting more and more impatient.
Several times did he pause at the door, to lay
his ear close to the heavy panel, and listen.
He wondered what could be keeping Bessie.
Surely she had had ample time to open the
door of her mother's room and explain everything
to the lady. In his excitement he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
pictured all sorts of fresh trouble as having
befallen the girl. What if by accident she had
run across the master German spy in the
corridor? But then, in such a case, Bessie
surely would have screamed in order to warn
her two friends that they were in danger of
being discovered, should Potzfeldt and some
of his assistants burst into the room.</p>

<p>Of course Jack had magnified things wonderfully.
Less than half the time had elapsed than
he thought had passed when there came a soft
scratching on the door to notify them Bessie
was there. They next heard a slight creaking
sound, and then the soft closing of the door.</p>

<p>"Bessie, is it you?" asked the eager Jack,
softly.</p>

<p>A reply in the affirmative followed.</p>

<p>"And here is mother with me," added the
girl, a note of joy in her voice, even though
she spoke in a whisper.</p>

<p>So they came together. In the semi-darkness
the boys could not see what Bessie's mother
looked like. They did note, however, that she
was small of stature; and this fact pleased Tom
very much indeed. For already he had figured
out just how the rescue must be carried out,
since there seemed to be no other way.</p>

<p>His plans would entail some sacrifice on
Jack's part, and also more or less exposure to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
peril; but then Tom knew his chum too well
to imagine he would hesitate even a moment
when called upon to take this additional burden
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Both of them squeezed the trembling hand
of the woman, and as best they were able
assured her that they meant to carry both
Bessie and herself to a place of safety, provided
they were courageous enough to trust themselves
to the care of two air pilots.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>FACING MORE DIFFICULTIES</span></h2>

<p>"As for me," spoke up Bessie, immediately,
just as Jack felt positive she would, "I'd like
nothing better. I've been up once in a hydro-airplane,
and would have gone many times if
mother had allowed me."</p>

<p>The lady did not seem to anticipate having
a very delightful time of it, for Tom felt her
shudder; but she was courageous, and evidently
ready to attempt any hazard in order to gain
her freedom.</p>

<p>"If only there is some way to fasten me
securely," she told them, "I am willing to do
anything you say, my brave boys. So make
your plans without regard to my feelings in
the matter."</p>

<p>Jack about this time evidently began to scent
something with regard to Tom's intuitions; at
least his word implied a growing skepticism
concerning their ability to find room for two
passengers aboard a plane intended only for
a pilot and an observer, or a gunner.</p>

<p>"Of course one could squeeze in alongside
me, Tom," he mentioned hesitatingly; "but do
you think it's wise to have anybody with you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
Mightn't it interfere with the working of the
controls, and add to the danger?"</p>

<p>"It certainly would, Jack; and that's why I'm
forced to call on you to make a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Go on and say what's on your mind, then,"
demanded Jack. "No matter what it's going
to be, you'll find me ready and willing for
anything."</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait for the second trip,"
Tom announced.</p>

<p>"All right, just as you say, Tom. When will
that be, later on to-night?"</p>

<p>"If it's possible to get back, yes," said the
other.</p>

<p>"But if you can't make it, then to-morrow
night, Tom?"</p>

<p>Jack was not overcome with fear, even though
the prospect did appear anything but cheerful.
Bessie listened to this low talk, and gave
evidence of growing anxiety.</p>

<p>"But why should this be necessary?" she put
in at that juncture. "I can stay behind just
as well as not. Then perhaps another night
later on you could come again, and take me
with you to the French lines, and safety."</p>

<p>Jack sniffed in disdain.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not, Bessie!" he told her,
almost sternly. "I'd just like to see myself
sailing away, and leaving you here to stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
the racket. No, both of you are going to
accompany Tom. I can find a hiding place
somewhere around; and besides, no one will
suspect that an American flier is hanging out
here. There's only one thing I hate like
everything to think of."</p>

<p>"And I can guess what that is," Tom said,
quickly. "You dread to contemplate a long
eatless day before you. That's the worst
punishment anyone could hand out to you,
Jack."</p>

<p>"As far as that goes," interrupted Bessie;
"I can tell Jack where the pantry window lies.
As the catch is broken you can easily climb in
through it later on to-night, and lay in a supply
of food. There is always something there.
Before that bad man shut me up he tried
to starve me, and I stole food myself. Then
he guessed what was happening, for he fastened
my door, and only allowed me to walk in the
grounds in company with a woman he has
for a housekeeper."</p>

<p>Thereupon Bessie gave Jack minute directions
how to find the window leading into the storeroom.
Thus armed the young aviator felt that
he ought to be able to stand it, in case his
comrade found it impracticable to return on
the same night.</p>

<p>"Since all that is fixed," remarked Tom, "it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
strikes me we had better get out of this place
quickly. Can you lead us down by way of
the stairs, Bessie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; for I know every foot of the way,"
she told him without hesitation. "You see, I
expected that some time we would have to slip
away by stealth; and so I made myself familiar
with everything, even to the fastenings of the
great front door, with its chain and catch."</p>

<p>"Then we're in great luck," Jack observed,
while Tom on his part went on to ask further.</p>

<p>"All seems dark outside now, Bessie; would
that indicate your jailer has gone to his bed?
And do you happen to know where his apartment
is? That might mean a whole lot to us,
you understand."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he ever does really go to
bed," she replied. "Once I heard him complain
that there were so many times during the night
that messengers came from headquarters with
demands, or after information expected from
over the lines, that he had to secure his sleep
while fully dressed, and by throwing himself
down on a Turkish lounge he has in his room."</p>

<p>"Well, so long as his sleep is sound it's little
we care how or when he gets it," announced
Jack, flippantly. "And when you give the word,
Tom, we'll all be ready to follow Bessie down
the stairs."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>Tom was even opening his mouth to say
there was really nothing to detain them, if
Bessie and her mother had secured what trifles
they wished to take away, but after all he did
not speak the words that were on his lips.</p>

<p>Through the open window they suddenly
heard the sound of heavy, guttural voices. They
seemed to come from the road near the entrance
gates.</p>

<p>Tom stepped over to the window and looked
out. What he saw gave him an unpleasant
feeling. There were lights already on the
crooked driveway, and a number of men seemed
to be advancing in a group.</p>

<p>Jack at his elbow was also staring, and
grinding his teeth with anger.</p>

<p>"Hang the luck, I say!" he gritted. "That
fresh bunch of Boche officers is bound to knock
our plans silly. They'll stir things up again,
and we can't get away. Then perhaps some
one will discover the doors of the two rooms
are unfastened, and that'll start a hornet's nest
about our ears."</p>

<p>"Get down, and keep hidden, Jack," urged
his companion. "They have lights with them,
and might see us as they come along. There's
a general, at least, in the lot, that big stout
man in the center, and I imagine those other
officers belong to his staff."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>"But what are they walking for?" whispered
Jack, incredulously. "German officers in the
High Command don't often tramp along the
roads like that, do they?"</p>

<p>"They may have broken down in their car;
and learning they were close to this house have
come on here to wait till repairs are made.
Lots of them know Potzfeldt, I suppose, and
one of these men may have been here before
on business. The worst of it all is we'll have
to give up our scheme of going down by way
of the stairs."</p>

<p>They crouched down and watched as best
they could, while the half-dozen men in the
gray-green uniforms of German officers, and
with many decorations on the breast of the
martial-looking commander, approached the
ch√¢teau's front door.</p>

<p>Already lights had sprung up on the lower
floor. Undoubtedly Potzfeldt had heard his
unexpected guests coming, and was bestirring
himself to welcome them, though inwardly
raving over having his rest so frequently
disturbed.</p>

<p>He met them at the door, and there ensued
more or less talking, all of it in the choicest
of German. Again Jack felt sorry that his
education was so incomplete that he could only
guess at what most of it meant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>Still, Tom could pick up a little of what was
said. There was certainly mention made of an
unfortunate accident to a car, that would
necessitate a delay of some hours for repairs,
possibly until morning. The general did not
altogether fancy sitting in the car for hours in
the cool night air. Especially was this the case
after he had learned that there was a house
half a mile or so further on where food and
drink could be obtained in plenty, if only they
chose to walk that far.</p>

<p>All of the newcomers had by now stalked
inside the house, and the coast seemed to be
clear, so far as those above could see. But
down below there was much hurrying to and
fro, which would indicate that Potzfeldt must
have aroused his retainers, and they were
running up and down from wine-cellar to
dining-room, bearing acceptable refreshments
for the unbidden guests.</p>

<p>"Say, I wonder if that old stout chap could
be Hindenburg himself?" Jack whispered in
his chum's ear. "I noticed that Mr. Potzfeldt
seemed mighty obsequious, as if he felt highly
honored at having such a noble visitor, and
nothing could be too good to set before him."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you'd hit
the nail on the head when you said that, Jack,"
the other told him. "He was a big, burly man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
with a mighty important air about him; and
he wore a mustache such as we've always seen
in pictures of Hindenburg. But no matter, it
doesn't concern us at all, if we can find a way
to get down from here."</p>

<p>"Only," said Jack, whimsically, "I do hope
if they've got their German appetites along,
they don't clean out that pantry before I get
my look-in, that's all. Twenty-four hours
without a single bite would be the limit for me.
I don't think I'd survive the ordeal. Now
what, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom was looking out again.</p>

<p>"That's lucky," Jack heard him mutter.</p>

<p>"Of course it is. But tell me what you're
referring to, Tom."</p>

<p>"Some clouds have come along. One is right
now covering the face of the moon, you notice.
Well, if we are forced to lower Bessie and her
mother from the window by means of a rope
made from knotted bed-sheets, we stand a
chance to avoid being discovered at work by
any one who might happen to be abroad just
then."</p>

<p>Jack chuckled as though pleased.</p>

<p>"Sure, that's the game, Tom! I knew you'd
be equal to getting up some sort of clever
scheme. And I'll start in right away making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
that rope. We want to be certain it's strong
enough to bear their weight, that's all."</p>

<p>"I'll help you at the job," Tom told him, for
he too wished to be positive about the twisted
parts of the sheets, before trusting the girl and
her mother to their care.</p>

<p>Fortunately they found that Carl Potzfeldt
had some of the airs of a millionaire about him.
The sheets were of stout linen, instead of the
customary cotton to which the American boys
were accustomed. When these were cut first
with a sharp pocket-knife, and then torn into
long strips about a foot or so in width, they
could be twisted and knotted until the result
was a novel rope of at least twenty feet in
length.</p>

<p>Neither Bessie nor her mother said a single
word. They seemed more than willing to be
thus lowered to the ground. Such a novel
experience might not be delightful, but it
amounted to very little when compared with
what they had suffered at the hands of their
rude and cruel captor.</p>

<p>Soon the odd rope was ready for use.</p>

<p>"Let me be the first to go down," Bessie
then said to Tom, in an authoritative voice.</p>

<p>As he had been about to propose the same
thing he made not the least objection, but
proceeded to secure one end of the strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
rope around her body just below the arms,
Bessie herself assisting in the operation.</p>

<p>Before attempting the task, Tom stood at
the window listening for some little time. He
wished to make sure that none of the German
officers had remained outside. Tom also meant
to satisfy himself that there was no lurking
form among the bushes on that side of the
ch√¢teau, since the light streaming from the
lower windows dissipated some of the advantages
gained by the temporary clouding of the
moon.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>LEFT BEHIND IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY</span></h2>

<p>Tom appeared finally to be satisfied, for he
turned around to Bessie.</p>

<p>"Now if you're ready we'll lower you safely,"
he told her.</p>

<p>The girl showed considerable nimbleness in
climbing over the window-sill. Jack insisted in
having a hand in dropping her slowly down.
It was not far, and in a few breaths the girl
had reached the solid, ground. She understood
what was expected of her, and immediately
cast off the rude rope, so it might be drawn
up and made to serve once more.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gleason showed just as much bravery
as her daughter, and was also lowered without
trouble.</p>

<p>"You go down next, Tom," whispered Jack.
"Then I'll draw it up, and can join you easily
enough without the help of the rope. A white
thing like this dangling here would be sure to
attract attention, if any one came around the
corner of the house, and might cost us dearly
in the end."</p>

<p>Tom understood. He preferred being the
last to stay, but since Jack had taken that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
upon himself, and was moreover adept at scaling
walls, it was folly to dispute his right.</p>

<p>So down Tom went. He had hardly landed
when the sheet-rope was swiftly drawn up, and
vanished within the room. After that Jack was
seen making his way down over the same route
he had taken while ascending.</p>

<p>Soon they were all together again, and their
queer exit from the room seemed not to have
been discovered, for which they felt very
thankful indeed.</p>

<p>Tom led the way into the friendly bushes
close by. It was his intention to skirt the
carriage-drive, as it might contain elements of
danger for them. Once they had passed out
on the main road to Metz, it would not take
them long to reach the field where the big
Caudron airplane lay like an exhausted and
enormous bat, awaiting their coming to spring
into activity.</p>

<p>In passing along they were enabled to catch
a glimpse of the interior of the dining-room
where Carl Potzfeldt was entertaining his
distinguished visitor to the best of his ability
in those times when scarcity ruled.</p>

<p>Tom managed to get a better look at the
general. He was more than ever convinced
that the big man with the strong features and
all these decorations on his uniform, was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
fact Hindenburg, the head of the whole German
army, whose opinion carried even more weight
with the people just then than that of Kaiser
Wilhelm.</p>

<p>It would be something worth while to be
able to say they had been within a dozen feet
of the famous commander, the Iron Man of
Germany. Tom vaguely wished he had some
means of capturing the general then and there,
and carrying him over the lines to the French
headquarters. That would indeed be a feat
well worth praise from General Petain; but
of course it was utterly impossible.</p>

<p>They gained the gate, and there Tom insisted
on looking carefully around so as to make
doubly certain that no sentinel had been left
on duty while General Hindenburg remained
within the house.</p>

<p>When this fact was made clear he led the
way forth. The little party of four almost ran
along the road, so eager were they to place
as much ground as possible between themselves
and the seat of danger.</p>

<p>There was always a chance that the flight
of Bessie and her mother might be discovered
by some one connected with the household, and
communicated to Potzfeldt. He, of course,
would exhaust every means in trying to overtake
the fugitives.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>But Tom chuckled while telling himself that
they must needs have extraordinary and fleet
steeds who could successfully pursue those who
had trusted their safety to his care and that of
the big Caudron airplane.</p>

<p>Jack hardly knew where the field lay, having
become "rattled," as he called it, from the
adventures at the ch√¢teau. So after all it was
fortunate that Tom had taken his bearings as
well as he had. He knew just when to leave
the road, and start across the open space. Then
the lone tree began to loom up, for the moon
had once more thrust her face from behind the
enveloping cloud.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Bessie," said Jack reassuringly.
"Our plane lies close to the foot of that tree
ahead there. If all goes well you'll be on your
way before many minutes have passed."</p>

<p>"Thanks to you, Jack," murmured the girl
admiringly.</p>

<p>"Shucks! that isn't a circumstance to what
I'd be willing to do for you and your mother!"
Jack boldly told her.</p>

<p>"But all the same it is very brave of you,
Jack, and I can never forget your kindness to
us," she insisted. "I hope and pray that nothing
terrible will happen to you while we're gone,
and that I'll soon see you again."</p>

<p>"I hope so too, Bessie," he chuckled, as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
amused. "As to anything happening to me, I
guess I know how to hide all right. The worst
that can knock me is getting a little mite
hungry, you know. If that big German general
and his staff leave a bite in the pantry I'm
going after it, believe me! Then I'll find a
hole, and crawl in, somewhere close by here,
so I can watch for Tom's return."</p>

<p>Apparently Jack had mapped his whole
programme out; and it seemed that an adequate
supply of provisions occupied the most prominent
place in them.</p>

<p>They were now at the spot where the Caudron
had been left. Tom's mind was eased of the
secret fears he had entertained when he saw
the machine was still where they had left it.
So far as he could tell no one had been near
to meddle with it.</p>

<p>First of all Bessie and her mother must be
fastened securely to the seat where Jack had
sat on the trip to Metz. Tom, like a wise
general, had provided himself with plenty of
the strips of linen from the torn sheets. This
he utilized in tying the passengers, so that there
would not be the slightest chance of their
falling out.</p>

<p>Even if Mrs. Gleason should faint through
terror on finding herself a mile up in the air,
she could not fall out of the machine. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
Tom entertained high hopes that both of his
passengers were going to display extraordinary
courage, and give him no cause at all for
anxiety.</p>

<p>Jack tried to assist in the operation, but
his hands were trembling so with the excitement
that Tom pushed him away.</p>

<p>"Leave the job to me, Jack," he told the
other. "Too many cooks spoil the broth, you
know. I'll make everything secure, depend on
it."</p>

<p>"Of course I know you will, Tom," the other
hastened to assure him. "Perhaps it is better
only one handled the business. And Bessie&#8211;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack," said the girl, slipping a hand
out toward him, which Jack took in his, and
pressed reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Don't bother your head for a single minute
about me, mind. I'll be all right, and perhaps
able to join you again this very night. It's
a great lark for me, and I wouldn't miss it
for a heap. But oh, if only we could kidnap
that big commander, and carry him over to
have an interview with General Petain, how
proud I'd be!"</p>

<p>Tom smiled on realizing that the same idea
had occurred to Jack that had flashed through
his own mind.</p>

<p>"Here, take my automatic, Jack," Tom said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
"You may find occasion to use it before I come
back."</p>

<p>The other complied, and apparently he felt
more confidence, once he knew he had in his
possession the means for defending himself
should any ordinary danger threaten. Tom
was loath to depart, once he had everything
arranged. The truth of the matter was he
hated to leave his chum in the enemy country;
it seemed as though he were deserting him.</p>

<p>So he "fiddled" around, testing this wire guy,
and using his electric hand torch to give him
light, so he could once more run his eye over
the motor on which he had been working.</p>

<p>"Come, Tom, it's no use hanging around
here a minute longer," Jack had finally to tell
him. "Get aboard and I'll spin your wheel
for you and give you a boost for a start. Then
I'll drop out of sight, because some of them
may run this way when they hear the clatter
and guess the cause."</p>

<p>Tom climbed to his seat and settled himself
according to his customary thorough manner.
He tried the controls, and was not satisfied
until he had tested everything within reach.</p>

<p>"Say when, Tom!" Jack remarked, having
finally left Bessie's side and gone to the
propellers of the big plane.</p>

<p>Tom drew in a long breath. He knew he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
had a risky venture ahead, taking those two
inexperienced passengers over the hostile lines,
possibly amidst showers of exploding shrapnel
shells. But it was not this that weighed so
heavily on his spirits. He felt almost like a
criminal at leaving Jack behind.</p>

<p>"All right; let her go!" he announced grimly.</p>

<p>There came a sudden whirring sound. Then
the loud hum of the motors chimed in, and
the big Caudron machine started off.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Tom! Good-bye, Bessie!" Jack
was heard saying, although the noise of the
plane almost drowned his voice.</p>

<p>Faster they went now, as the machine gained
momentum. Tom paid strict attention to his
business of pilot. At just the proper time he
must elevate the forward rudder which would
cause the plane to leave the ground and start
upward at a sharp angle.</p>

<p>Jack stood gazing after the object that was
quickly growing more and more indistinct in
the dim moonlight, gazing with a strange
heaviness in the region of his heart. He had
to shut his teeth firmly together to conquer
the momentary weakness that threatened to
overpower him. But his resolution remained
master of the field.</p>

<p>"If only he gets them safely across," Jack
muttered to himself, when he could no longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
see the airplane, though its noisy working came
plainly to his ears, "it'll be all right. But
they've heard the racket over at the house,
too, I guess, because men are shouting, and
I can see lights flashing this way and that."</p>

<p>When he discovered that men with lanterns
were actually looking around as if to learn
where the departing airplane could have been
resting, and what it all meant, Jack concluded
it was time to conceal himself.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>TROUBLOUS TIMES FOR JACK</span></h2>

<p>The men bearing the lanterns came closer,
Jack saw, as he himself scurried amidst the
bushes seeking a hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Guess that Potzfeldt must know that planes
can drop down on his big open field," the
youth muttered to himself. Then as a new idea
flashed through his brain he continued: "Whee!
I warrant you now that ours wasn't the first
airplane to land there. Sometimes maybe the
spy he wants to send back of the French lines
gets aboard right here, with his little cage of
homers."</p>

<p>Presently loud exclamations told that the
men had discovered the marks of the arriving
and departing Caudron machine. Jack could
hear them exchanging remarks about it, in
German of course. Then he saw one of the
trio start back toward the house. He was
half running, as though much excited. Jack
jumped to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"Say," he said to himself, in a whisper, as
though even the sound of his own voice might
be company for him, "now that must have been
Carl Potzfeldt himself. What's he making for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
the house with a hop, skip and jump for?
Perhaps one of his sharp-eyed men has told
him there are marks of small shoes around; and
old Carl got a sudden suspicion something
tremendous has happened."</p>

<p>The master-spy came back again. He was
now accompanied by two others, and Jack saw
by their uniforms that they were members of
the general's staff.</p>

<p>All were talking earnestly, Potzfeldt, Jack
imagined, telling them some story concerning
Bessie and her mother, in which he figured
as a noble man, trying to save Mrs. Gleason
from the wiles of some American fortune
hunter, into whose hands he now feared she
and her daughter had fallen.</p>

<p>"My! but he's wild!" chuckled the hidden
observer. "He realizes that the two American
boys have been too much for his scheming
after all. Guess he must have had a suspicion
all along we'd break up his game. That'd
account for his plotting with the other spy to
have our planes meddled with, so we'd meet
with some terrible accident that would remove
us from his path."</p>

<p>Jack was really enjoying himself. It did him
good to hear Potzfeldt raging around, and
spluttering as though his rage half choked him.</p>

<p>What Bessie had said concerning the cruel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
treatment she had received at the hands of her
mother's relative had fired Jack's blood. He
detested a man who in order to accumulate
money could treat a helpless woman and girl
as Potzfeldt had those who were in his power.</p>

<p>"I'd just like," he was telling himself as he
listened, "to be one of three fellows who had
that villain in their power, with a nice big
kettle of hot tar handy, ditto three feather
pillows. Oh, wouldn't we make him a queer
bird, though! The extinct dodo'd have nothing
on him, believe me! But it's fine to hear him
raging around like that. I only wish Bessie
could listen."</p>

<p>After a time Potzfeldt and his men went
away. They knew they could do nothing, as
the big enemy plane had long since departed,
and must by then be many miles on the return
journey to the French lines.</p>

<p>An hour went by and all seemed quiet in
the region of the big house by the side of
the road. Jack had not forgotten the promise
made to himself. It might mean additional
danger, to be sure; but when he thought of
a long day ahead, in all probability, with an
empty stomach constantly reproaching him, he
felt equal to the task.</p>

<p>He had no trouble in finding the entrance
to the grounds. Everything seemed quiet, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
though the general and his staff were endeavoring
to get a little sleep before resuming their
journey to the fighting front.</p>

<p>Jack was soon under the window that had
been described to him by Bessie. It gave light
to the pantry during the daytime. Also he
had been assured, the catch that secured it
was broken, so that if he were bold enough
he could easily gain entrance and take his pick
of what the housekeeper had stored there.</p>

<p>Such a nimble chap as Jack had no difficulty
whatever in making an entrance. Finding
himself within the big closet, he listened, and,
hearing no sound, struck a match.</p>

<p>By the light thus afforded he could see what
lay within his reach. Trust one with an empty
stomach for knowing what he wants under such
conditions. Jack immediately commenced to
gather together a supply of food of various
kinds, such as could be eaten without need for
a fire.</p>

<p>Quantity rather than quality seemed to rule
his actions. At any rate, when he gathered
his spoils together he had quite enough to last
an ordinary man several days.</p>

<p>"Well," he told himself, when lifting the
bundle he had made. "I may be marooned
around here a long time, and never get another
chance at this supply station. I believe in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
striking while the iron's hot. Now to get it
outside without raising a crowd."</p>

<p>It was indeed a lucky thing that there was
no watch-dog at the Potzfeldt place. Undoubtedly
this was because of the many
visitors coming and going at all times, who
might be bothered by a savage beast.</p>

<p>Jack managed to get back safely to the nest
where he had hidden at the time of the
excitement, when Potzfeldt and his men were
in the field. He gave a sigh of relief after
it was all over.</p>

<p>Soon the young aviator settled down to try
to get some sleep, as some time still remained
before dawn would break. He meant to be
early astir. There was danger in the air, as
he might be discovered unless he arranged for
a better hiding place than the covert of bushes
where he now lay.</p>

<p>Whether his sleep was worth while, or
rendered uneasy by dreams, Jack never told.
He was awake though, when the sun peeped
above the horizon, and began to bestir himself.
Presently people would be moving about. Some
of the men might even come out to the open
field again, to look at the telltale marks. And
if they chanced to suspect that one of the crew
of the Caudron had been left behind, a hasty
search was apt to reveal his presence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>Accordingly Jack commenced to retire deeper
into the wood, and managed by great care to
cover his tracks fairly well in so doing. Finally
he found a place that seemed to him about
as good as anything he might expect to run
across; and so he crawled into the bushes again.</p>

<p>Then he had a most pleasing task to start
upon, which was nothing more nor less than
that of appeasing his appetite, never more
voracious, he fancied, than just then. Without
a twinge of conscience regarding the fact that
it was stolen food he disposed of, Jack
commenced his morning meal.</p>

<p>"I'm only enjoying some of the good stuff
that scoundrel deprived Bessie of," he told himself,
with a grin of contentment, after he had
eaten until he could not take another bite.
"Besides, everything is fair in war-times. When
you're raiding through the enemy's country it's
supposed you'll live on the spoils around you.
Well, I'm going to live, and Carl Potzfeldt is
my enemy, all right. He's proved that in a
dozen different ways."</p>

<p>That idea set him to thinking about Bessie
again, how she had taken such a queer way to
try to warn him, after overhearing her guardian
plotting with one of his men the injury to one
or both of the young Americans.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder," Jack mused, as he lay in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
perfect peace with the world, for he had eaten
his fill, "how he knew we had joined the Lafayette
Escadrille. But then those German spies
learn a lot of things, and he may have been
keeping tabs on Tom and me right along. Deep
down in his heart he suspected we'd bother him,
and so he wanted to get us before we had a
chance to strike. Well, the shoe is on the other
foot, it seems."</p>

<p>The morning advanced. Fortunately it
proved to be a fair day for so early in April.
Had a storm arisen Jack might have found it
hard to find shelter. As it was, all he had to
do was to lie under the bushes and doze from
time to time.</p>

<p>Whenever he got to thinking of Tom a queer
feeling came over him. It made him uneasy,
though he could not explain why that should
be so; and from time to time he took himself
to task for being worried.</p>

<p>"Of course Tom got back safe and sound,"
he would muse. "He's too clever a pilot to
make a bad job of such a business. And yet,
if he doesn't come to-night I'll be terribly
anxious. Oh, forget all that! will you, Jack
Parmly? Think of something pleasant now.
For instance, that it's nearly high noon, and
most folks lunch then."</p>

<p>He had just calmed down again, when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
had a sudden chill. Men were working in a
field about three hundred yards away, for he
could hear them calling to one another in
German.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a series of snappy barks.
Jack looking around was horrified to discover
a small dog. It was a dachschund, long of body,
and with crooked, bandy legs. It was standing
before the hidden boy and evidently bent on
telling everybody by his barks that some
suspicious person was hiding in the bushes.</p>

<p>It was a crisis that made Jack's blood run
cold!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>BACK TO SAFETY&#8211;CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>Jack hardly knew what to do. He made
threatening gestures at the dog, but they, of
course, only added to the trouble, for the animal
renewed his barking more briskly than ever.</p>

<p>Then Jack had an inspiration, such as sometimes
comes when all seems lost. If the dog
continued his barking, sooner or later one of
the men working in the field not far off would
have his curiosity aroused, and come to
ascertain what sort of wild animal the dog had
treed.</p>

<p>Jack unfastened his package of food. Since
stern tactics had no effect he meant to try to
make friends with the dachschund. Dogs are
always more or less hungry, he argued; and
this must be especially true at that time in every
part of Germany, Alsace-Lorraine not excepted,
since the pinch of two-and-a-half years of war
had made terrible inroads on all kinds of food.</p>

<p>Jack commenced to eat. The dog kept on
barking, though not quite so savagely now.
The smell of the food had reached him, and he
would occasionally give a little imploring whine
between his barks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>So Jack spoke to him in a soft, wheedling
tone. Then he held up a scrap of meat, and
caught the eager attention of the little beast;
after which he tossed it to him. It vanished
like a flash. The dog even wagged his tail, as
if to let the man know his animosity was
quickly giving way to interest. Surely any one
who had all that food along with him could not
be a suspicious personage.</p>

<p>The next scrap fell a little short, and the dog
advanced to get it. So by degrees Jack tempted
him, until in the end he was patting the squatty
animal on the back, and still feeding him. They
were now the best of friends. Kindness had
accomplished what all the threatening gestures,
supplemented with many sticks hurled at the
beast, could never have brought about.</p>

<p>Jack believed he had saved himself from
discovery. He could easily understand what
hardships must have awaited him had he ever
fallen into the hands of Carl Potzfeldt.</p>

<p>The afternoon went by very tediously. The
dog came and went, staying for short periods
with Jack. The vast store of food was a magnet
that held the little beast fast. It had doubtless
been a long time since he had had his full.</p>

<p>By degrees the day waned, and evening came
along.</p>

<p>Jack never saw the sun set with less regret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
than he did on that occasion. Still he knew
that long hours must pass before the moon
would peep in view above the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>As he sat, he allowed his thoughts to roam
backward. Once more in imagination he could
see his friends who were on the other side of
the ocean. Then for a change he would take
another "snack," as he called it, for lack of
anything else to occupy his attention.</p>

<p>Several times also he dozed, but always
arousing with a start at some sound, under the
impression that it might be Tom who had
come, and, not finding him, gone away again.</p>

<p>Finally he began to believe it must surely be
past midnight; and the late moon would
presently be making an appearance. On looking
closely toward the east he became aware
that the heavens were betraying such a fact,
for a distinct silvery glow was beginning to
appear, low down.</p>

<p>Then came a streak of light. It was the
moon. Slowly she mounted higher, as if more
or less ashamed of the dilapidated appearance
of her usually smiling face.</p>

<p>Jack had earlier in the night changed his
place of lodging. He again occupied his former
quarters close to the spot where he and Tom
had landed when they wished to overhaul the
motor that was acting so badly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>The minutes dragged.</p>

<p>Then once more Jack bent his head, and put
a hand up to his ear to listen. He laughed to
himself with glee.</p>

<p>"That's Tom coming!" he muttered joyously.
"I knew Tom wouldn't fail me. All the same I'll
be mighty glad when I'm aboard the plane and
on the air route to Bar-le-Duc and my own cot."</p>

<p>Louder grew the sounds. There could not be
the slightest doubt about it now, Jack decided.
A plane was coming at top speed, and keeping
not a great distance above the treetops of the
little valley in which the house of Carl Potzfeldt
and the road to Metz lay.</p>

<p>Louder grew the insistent drumming. Jack
wondered whether some of those at the ch√¢teau
might not also hear the racket, and, guessing
what it would mean, hasten out to the field
in time to give Tom and himself a volley of
shots.</p>

<p>Now the plane was coming, like a great
condor of the Andes about to alight on a
mountain peak. Jack gauged full well where
it would land. He ran with all his might to be
close to the spot. The less time wasted in
getting him aboard the better for their safety,
he believed, remembering what cause Carl
Potzfeldt now had for being suspicious when a
plane visited his meadow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>Then the big Caudron ran along the ground
and came to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom, I'm here, and mighty glad to
see you!" cried the lad who had counted the
minutes until his brain seemed to reel with the
strain.</p>

<p>"Get aboard in a hurry, Jack. We've no time
to waste here."</p>

<p>"I know that even better than you do,"
returned the other.</p>

<p>There was indeed need of haste. The air
service boys could hear voices from where the
ch√¢teau was located. Someone had heard the
humming of the oncoming airplane. It was
Potzfeldt himself, and now he and two of his
men came hurrying out on the field, all armed
with pistols.</p>

<p>Jack only waited to give the propellers a
whirl, and then, as the motor took up its work,
he made a leap for his seat. Oh, how good it
seemed to be once more in that airplane!</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" roared a guttural voice in
German. "Stop, or we fire!"</p>

<p>Now the airplane was moving along the
ground, bumping and rocking considerably.
But Tom knew how to manage, and presently
the plane commenced to soar slowly upward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>Loud and angry voices announced the fact
that Carl Potzfeldt had arrived close enough to
get a view of the rising plane in the misty light
of the moon.</p>

<p>"Stop! I command you! Stop!" roared the
German. And then came the crack! crack!
crack! of firearms.</p>

<p>The air service boys, because of the noise of
the motor, did not hear the discharge of the
pistols, but suddenly Jack heard the spatter of
a bullet as it struck the machine close beside
him. Then he ducked and made a motion to
Tom to let his chum know that they were under
fire.</p>

<p>But the machine was gaining headway
rapidly, and presently they were so high that
those below could no longer reach them. Up
and up they went until they were thousands of
feet above the valley that had been the scene of
this remarkable adventure.</p>

<p>Tom headed back along the course he had
just come. It was now easy to pick up one
landmark after another, and in due course of
time they passed over the lines once more. Of
course, the sound of the plane's propellers was
heard by the Germans, and some shrapnel was
sent after them; but as Tom was careful to
keep high in the air, this did not reach them,
and soon they were out of the danger belt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>Fifteen minutes later they made a landing,
this time on the well remembered aviation field
of Bar-le-Duc. Here there were attendants on
hand ready to care for the machines.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you got back," said one of the
attendants, grinning. He knew that Tom had
gone off on the second trip to bring Jack.</p>

<p>The two air service boys found a car to take
them to the villa. The long ride through the
night air had made both of them very sleepy,
and yet neither felt just then like retiring.</p>

<p>"It's a lucky thing, Tom," said Jack, between
yawns, "that I had this fur-lined pilot's coat
along with me. Only for that I'd have been
mighty cold out there in the open last night,
with no chance for a fire."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all past now, Jack. Tell me what
happened to you during my absence."</p>

<p>Jack, was nothing loath, and as quickly as
possible gave his chum the particulars of how
he had gone into hiding and almost been
betrayed by the dog.</p>

<p>Tom had already told Jack about what had
become of Mrs. Gleason and Bessie. They had
been taken to a house some miles back of the
lines, and were to be made comfortable there
for the night.</p>

<p>"And early in the morning they are to start
for Paris," Tom said with satisfaction. "I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
managed through our captain to get them
passage aboard a train that is to take some
wounded back to the base hospitals. Mrs.
Gleason says she means to stay in Paris and
help all she can as a Red Cross nurse, for she
has had some experience in nursing."</p>

<p>"That's fine!" was Jack's comment. And
then for the time being he became somewhat
silent.</p>

<p>Tom could easily understand that his chum
was cherishing a hope that some time or other
when they were taking a vacation from their
arduous duties while flying for France, the pair
of them might visit the French metropolis, and
if so they would certainly try to see Bessie and
her mother again.</p>

<p>"And I've got more news to tell," remarked
Tom, when the pair were about to turn in for
their much-needed sleep. "You'll remember
about that message we found in the capsule on
the leg of the homing pigeon. Well, one of the
other pigeons we found was used to send a false
message to the Germans, telling them that a
certain part of the French line was very weak.
A short while later the Germans made a furious
attack on that part of the line, and, believe me,
they caught it for fair&#8211;the plucky French
soldiers, aided by the artillery, literally wiped
up the ground with them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>"That's great news!" cried Jack. "Then it
paid to bring down that pigeon, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"It sure did, Jack!"</p>

<p>Two days later came a most important
announcement, especially to the American
airmen.</p>

<p>"Things are coming our way at last," the
valiant commander announced, as they crowded
about him. "The papers this morning say that
Uncle Sam has at last got his back up. Any
day may now bring the glorious news from
across the Atlantic, telling that the United
States has taken the steps that will put her in
this World War against the Central Powers.
Then it will be all over but the shouting."</p>

<p>"That's right!" cried Jack.</p>

<p>"You just leave it to Uncle Sam to do it!"
added Tom.</p>

<p>Many more adventures were in store for the
young aviators, and what some of them were
will be related in the next volume of this series,
to be entitled "Air Service Boys Over the Rhine;
Or, Fighting Above the Clouds."</p>

<p>And here for the present let us leave the air
service boys and say good-bye.</p>
